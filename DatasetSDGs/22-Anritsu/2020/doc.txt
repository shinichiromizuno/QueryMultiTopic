Anritsu Way
The identity that typifies Anritsu Corporation, and which the Company has dedicatedly fostered since its foundation, is compressed in two phrases in its Corporate Philosophy: “Sincerity, Harmony, and Enthusiasm” and “Original & High Level.”
    Corporate Philosophy
Company Philosophy

Company Policy
1. Make energetic organization synthesizing the knowledge of all employees
2. Capture growth drivers through innovation
3. Be a leader in the global market
4. Contribute to the creation of a society that is friendly to people and the Earth as a good corporate citizen
 “Sincerity, Harmony, and Enthusiasm”
can be defined as the management philosophy that shows our mindset and values, including the attitude, thoughts, and pre- paredness the Company has in conducting business
Sincerity: Harmony:
Enthusiasm:
Reliability to meet the expectations of customers and all stakeholders
Adaptability to respond promptly to changes in the business environment and society’s demands by using all knowledge of all parties from inside and outside the Company
Innovativeness to provide new value by polishing up cutting-edge technologies such as 5G and IoT
“Original & High Level”

(1) The superior social and customer value provided by our prod- ucts and services
(2) The corporate culture, management system, and work proce- dural methods that give rise to those kinds of deliverables
  Brand Statement envision : ensure
To provide a more specific image to the ideas of “Sincerity, Harmony, and Enthusiasm” and “Original & High Level” that are key to what makes Anritsu unique, we have created the clear, concise, and globally universal phrase “envision: ensure” as our brand statement.
We believe this brand statement effectively encapsulates Anritsu’s message “to share our dream with our customers and create a vision that, through innovation, leads to tangible results that exceed customer expectations.”
Society is currently confronted with a wide variety of sustainability-related issues, including those related to the development of social infrastructure, including next-generation information and communications networks, as symbolized by 5G and IoT, as well as issues related to ensuring food safety and security, and realizing greater efficiency in the distribution of food.
Anritsu has contributed to technological innovation and society by providing products that meet the needs of customers, including TV broadcasting equipment, Japan’s first radio broadcast receiver and the world’s first practical wireless telephone. Inheriting this pioneer spirit, we will continue to contribute to the realization of a safe, secure, and prosperous global society by promoting sustainability man- agement and contributing to the resolution of social issues, including those outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Sustainability Policy
The Anritsu Group believes our business should increase our long-term value through contributions to the sustainability of global society with “sincerity, harmony, and enthusiasm.”
  1. We will contribute to building a safe, secure, and comfortable society through our business activities, based on our long-term vision
2. We will maintain harmony with the global socio-economy and society through ethical company activities
3. We will contribute to the preservation of the global environ- ment by promoting environmental management for the coexistence of people and nature
4. We will build strong partnerships by promoting communica- tion with all stakeholders

Group CEO Message
     We Contribute to a Safe and Secure
Society through Measurement
Anritsu was founded in 1895, the year of the world’s first successful wireless communication experiment, and 2020 is the 125th year since its original foundation. Our long history has been continuous challenges as a pioneer in the field of information and communications technology. Various innovations in telecommunications infrastructure have dramatically revolutionized society and enriched our lives by “connecting” people moving the global society forward.
Under the company philosophy of “Sincerity, Harmo- ny, and Enthusiasm” and “Original & High Level,” Anrit- su is leveraging its measurement technologies, honed to create visibility of products related to the informa- tion and communications field, into the fields of food and pharmaceuticals to contribute to a safe and secure society. We will continue to share the dreams with our customers, driving innovation to give the dreams tangi- ble form that exceeds expectations.
“envision : ensure” Please look to Anritsu in the future.

Representative Director, President of Anritsu Group CEO
  Regarding the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
All of us in the Anritsu Group extend our deepest condo- lences and sympathies for the many lives that have been lost and the many people who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Group established the COVID-19 response headquar- ters and responded to the WHO declaration of Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020. We were quick to institute staggered working hours, working remotely, incentives for commuting by automobile, and other efforts to contain the spread of infection. We will continue to work from home, maintain social distancing in locations such as meeting rooms, elevators, and cafeterias, enforce disinfection in workplaces, instill non-contact ways of work- ing, and enact other initiatives aimed at the new normal. While an uncertain outlook remains before us, we will con- tinue striving to ensure the health of our employees and their families while minimizing the impact on our business.
Progress on GLP2020 as We Head into Its Final Year
Progress on GLP2020
Test and Measurement Business: 5G services have been launched in the U.S., South Korea, Europe, and subse- quently in China as telecommunications carriers in several countries steadily progressed their commercialization schedules. In Japan, too, 5G services were partially launched in March 2020 primarily in large urban areas.
In such backdrop, our business continued to benefit from robust demand for development of 5G chipsets and mobile devices. In Japan and other Asian regions in particular, demand for development aimed at 5G commercialization grew, driving our 5G business. In addition, in the second half of FY2019 we began providing 5G conformance test systems for test laboratories and telecommunications carri- ers around the world.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results was negligible.

 demand due to work from home. There is an increase in measurement demand related to servers, routers, and other equipment used in data centers and networks, and for optical devices used with them. Given these move- ments in the communications test and measurement mar- ket, we intend to place 5G at the center of our business, and additionally, capture increasing demand in higher- speed networks and in fields of 5G applications, to meet the final-year targets of GLP2020.
PQA Business: Taking the expansion of quality assurance needs for the food and pharmaceuticals markets as its growth driver, the PQA Business aims to focus on related markets to expand its business by growing its overseas sales ratio to 50% in the long term.
However, the impact of COVID-19 has prevented initia- tives in overseas markets from progressing as expected. Going forward, along with an expected resumption in eco- nomic activity, the PQA Business will accelerate its overseas business expansion particularly in Asia and North America, and will work to draw closer to the final-year targets of GLP2020.
For Beyond 2020, and Next 10-Year Vision
Initiatives for Beyond 2020
Anritsu has launched Beyond 2020 with the aim of achiev- ing sustainable growth from 2020 onward. At present, the cornerstones of our business are 5G communications in the Test and Measurement Business and food safety in the PQA Business. To further expand and stabilize our business, we are tackling 5G applications and the automobile sector in the Test and Measurement Business, pharmaceutical safety in the PQA Business, and the environmental test and mea- surement business as new sectors to develop. We also established the Advanced Technology Research Center, a new basic technology laboratory that draws on the power of test and measurement to resolve the societal issues of a decade in the future. While conducting research into 6G and next-generation NEMS technology, the Center will actively accept researchers from outside to create a source of technological capability for Anritsu and to strengthen our philosophy of “Original & High Level.”

About Sustainability Management
About Our Initiatives Toward the SDGs
In April 2018, our Group established a Sustainability Policy that aims to improve our corporate value through contribu- tions to the sustainability of global society, in the spirit of “Sincerity, Harmony, and Enthusiasm.”
Under this policy, we set targets related to the SDGs, with the entire Group working to provide technologies, products, and solutions that support the development of safe and secure infrastructure as a foundation for industrial and technological innovation, and that promote innovation and the creation of industries related to the construction of a sustainable society. With respect to ESG, we have uphold- ed key issues to address on themes such as “promotion of the global environment protection”, “harmony with the
global economic society”, and “strengthening governance”. Appropriately disclosing these activities, and connecting the understanding and expectations of stakeholders to the improvement of corporate value, are the key issues for our
management.
As a unique initiative aimed at the reduction of green-
house gases, a key issue among the SDGs, we formulated “Anritsu Climate Change Action PGRE 30*”. Under this ini- tiative, we aim to boost our ratio of in-house generated renewable energy from 0.8% of internal electrical con- sumption in FY2018 to about 30% by around 2030.
Our company engages in activities that promote recogni- tion of the SDGs as issues of our own. PGRE 30 is one such initiative that will contribute to achieving the targets of the SDGs. The Anritsu Group will improve its corporate value through contribution to the SDGs and to the sustainability of global society, in a spirit of “Sincerity, Harmony, and Enthusiasm.”
* PGRE 30: “PGRE” refers to Private Generation of Renewable Energy and “30” refers to the target of 30% Private Generation of Renewable Energy by around 2030.

 Build a Robust Financial Structure by Focusing on Cash Flow and Aiming to Maximize Corporate Value
The biggest issues addressed in GLP 2020 are restoring growth in our core business, raising ROE by markedly improving operating profit margin, and actively making growth investments to build a business portfolio that is not affected by mobile technology evo- lutionary cycles. To that end, in our management we have incor- porated a high-level of importance on capital cost, maximized cash generation capabilities, and enhanced corporate value.

       Improving Corporate Value
We have established two KPIs as indices of corporate value improvement, and are managing these targets. As a numerical target, we use ROE, due to its ease of compara- bility with other companies, while as a quantitative target, we use Anritsu Capital-cost Evaluation (ACE*1) an original index that measures economic added-value. ACE is defined as “after-tax operating profit minus the cost of capital.” If after-tax operating profit does not exceed the cost of capi- tal, we do not regard it as having positive economic add- ed-value. In other words, we can assume that no corporate value has been created in such case.
*1 ACE (Anritsu Capital-cost Evaluation): Net operating profit after tax – Cost of capi- tal (5%). The Company’s cost of capital was calculated as 7% for shareholder equity cost, and 5% for the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used in our ACE index.
Aiming for 15% ROE
Anritsu considers achieving 15% ROE to be a priority man- agement issue. To realize medium- to long-term growth in the global market, it is essential that we create adequate profits as a source of funds for investment. An ROE of 15% is the global standard and is considered to be an engine for profitable growth.
ROE is analyzed using three factors: “profitability,” “effi- ciency,” and “leverage.”

Thorough Cash Flow Management
To realize sustainable investment for growth, it is essential to strengthen our ability to generate cash flow. Our con- stant goal is to maintain our operating cash flow margin above 13% (achievable by realizing an operating profit margin of 18% and avoiding increases in working capital), and to raise our CCC*2, which is a cash flow improvement index, to 120 days (the best result over the last 10 years) in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. These targets will be realized by improving profitability through cost reductions and more efficient spending, as well as improving asset efficiency through measures such as reducing inventory and promoting the collection of accounts receivable.
Moreover, as part of our capital cost-conscious manage- ment approach, we are also focusing on cash flow man- agement in each division. As specific measures, we create a balance sheet for each division, and are working on man- agement accounting practices, such as visualizing changes in cash and working capital. These measures are aimed at improving capital efficiency management in each division.

FY2019
         Our initiatives targeting each of the three factors of profit- ability, efficiency, and leverage are as follows.
Profitability
Investment to Realize Growth
For the Test and Measurement Business, which is our main strength, we will focus on strengthening our competitive- ness in 5G, while for the PQA Business, we will focus on investment aimed at global business development.
We have adopted development ROI (gross profit/devel- opment investment) as the standard for investment levels and are working to improve investment efficiency with the goal of realizing development ROI of 4.0 or higher.
Improving Cost Structure
We are also actively working to strengthen our cost struc- ture to enhance profitability. For example, we are aggres- sively taking steps to achieve higher efficiency in our sales activities and improve business processes in our corporate department by appropriately managing and pursuing improvements in cost per order (CPO) in each sales region, in order to make the cost structure in each business seg- ment adequate.
GLP 2020 measures aimed at improving profitability in each business are as follows.
Test and Measurement Business : Firmly capture the ini- tial launch of 5G business, recover high-growth rates in the mobile T&M business, which is one of Anritsu’s strengths, and recover the cost of investments in 5G development with high returns.
PQA Business : Improving price competitiveness or, in other words, improving gross profit margin is the key issue. The specific measures we will take are (1) differentiate our X-ray inspection system business, (2) provide new solutions through analysis of quality data, (3) expand our business in the European market, (4) fully enter the pharmaceuticals market, and (5) add value to operations across the entire value chain.

Building a Robust Financial Structure
Our basic policy for building a robust financial structure is to maintain a capital adequacy ratio ≥ 60% and a debt-to-equity ratio (D/E)*3 ≤ 30%. In a rapidly changing market, having a strong financial base that supports medi- um- to long-term growth is extremely important. Anritsu’s robust financial base has been evaluated, and our ratings by Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I) as of March 31, 2020, was “a-1” for short-term, and “A-” for long-term.
of 30% or higher, primarily by raising the dividend on equity (DOE) in response to an increase in consolidated net income. We also flexibly implement other measures regarding share- holder return that take the total return ratio into account. The total shareholder return (TSR) results over the past
10 years are as follows.
We will continue to implement growth strategies and
sound finance and capital policies that will enable us to realize a TSR that exceeds capital cost (7%).

Harnessing the Corporate Value Improvement Cycle
Improving profitability and efficiency, and maximizing the capability to generate cash flow are fundamental for improving corporate value. By aggressively investing strate- gically in new product development and M&A, we will work to strengthen the competitiveness of our solutions and improve our business foundation to achieve high returns. In addition, by enhancing shareholder returns and building a robust financial position, we will be able to har- ness the corporate value improvement cycle.

FY2019 Initiatives and Results
In our main business, the Test and Measurement Business, we achieved an operating profit margin of 20%. This was mainly due to firmly capturing the rapidly growing demand for 5G development in Japan and Asia. As a result, the operating profit margin for the Anritsu group was 16.3% and ROE was 14.9%. Following this profit growth, we raised the total annual dividend from the ¥22 per share initially planned to ¥31 per share. Also, in recognition of our im- proved profitability and robust financial structure, in May 2020, R&I changed the rating outlook of our “A-” long-term rating from “Stable” to “Positive.”

Revenue rose to ¥107,023 million up 7.4% compared with the previous fiscal year. In the Test and Measurement Business, demand increased to develop 5G, especially in Asia, and demand to develop 5G chipsets and mobile terminals for the mobile market is robust. In the PQA Business there was solid demand for investment in equipment targeting automation, labor saving and strengthening improvements for quality assurance processes in the food market in Japan and overseas. However, despite this, revenue was lower than the previous fiscal year due to impacts such as the lengthening of inspection periods at customer sites for products ordered.

  Anritsu is dedicated to reducing our energy consumption—which constitutes more than 98% of our CO2 emissions (Scope 1, 2)—and we are making steady progress in this regard. Going forward, we are striving to aggressively adopt renewable energy and shift to a self-generating and self-consuming system for electricity. We set a long-term CO2 emissions target for 2030, which was approved by the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative. Further- more, we set tentative long-term targets for 2050. In FY2019 CO2 emissions were down 2.3% compared with the previous fiscal year, to 12,443 t-CO2.
In FY2019, total energy consumption of the Anritsu Group overall (crude oil conversion basis) increased by 6.4% year on year. In the Domestic Anrit- su Group energy consumption increased by 2.9% but energy consumption was reduced 1.2% along with reduction measures such as reviewing the operating criteria for air-conditioners and updating to air-conditioning equipment with high efficiency.

  In FY2019, the Anritsu Group’s water usage increased 9.4% year on year. This is due to the increase in overtime hours along with increased produc- tion and the increase in water usage for the newly introduced production process at Anritsu Company (California, USA). In addition, the relaxation water saving policies in the state of California enabled the resumption of watering for plants to maintain the landscape.

Risks and Opportunities
     Anritsu Group Risk Management
The globalization of the economy in recent years has contributed to an ongoing increase in corporate business opportunities. Amid such conditions, companies are faced with a variety of social obligations and must take on a multifaceted approach to risk management. In order for the Anritsu Group to achieve a global expansion in its business and sustainable profit growth, the Company needs to estab- lish a system capable of responding to a variety of risks with the potential to impact business, and at the same time promote risk management on a company-wide basis.
The Anritsu Group views risks as the uncertain events that affect corporate value such as organiza- tional profit and social credibility. In other words, we do not consider risks as necessarily negative but instead as potentially positive events if managed appropriately. We recognize proper risk management as a vital management issue and have established a risk management system for the Anritsu Group as a corporate entity. We focus on initiatives that will enhance the risk sensitivity of all employees. At the same time, we promote risk management through an all-inclusive effort to maintain and expand our cor- porate value, fulfill our corporate social responsibility and seek sustainable development for the Group.

  Technology Development for the Commercialization of 6G in 2030
Initial 5G trials services commenced in 2019, followed by 5G commercial services launched overseas in the same year and in Japan in March 2020. Unfortunately, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games, slated as the stage for 5G’s spectacular debut, were postponed for one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, changes in lifestyles and restrictions on activities have made advanced ICT infrastructure to support the digitalization of society all the more important, drawing even greater atten- tion to 5G. Interest is growing in local 5G, for which 28GHz band license applications began in December 2019. Policy measures to promote 5G are being hammered down, as seen in the allocation of Sub-6GHz bands, discus- sions to enable outdoor use, and the readying of tax incen- tives for investment in 5G. We have hopes that, with the start of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, 2021 will be a breakthrough year for 5G.
Although 5G has just made its start, preparations pro- jecting a decade ahead to 6G have already begun around the world. The aim of 5G is not only the advancement of the communications infrastructure existing through 4G, but also the transformation of society artificial intelligence and the IoT as components of lifestyle infrastructure together with artificial intelligence and IoT. 6G is expected to form foundational technology for taking this infrastruc- ture even further.
Forecasts call for 6G to launch around 2028, with full- scale use around 2030. Under the Japanese government’s proposal for Society 5.0, a concept expected to see realiza- tion around the same time as 6G, the fusion of physical space and cyber space will further advance. Physical space is the real space in which we live, while cyber space is the vir- tual space constructed through computers and networks. Within current information society, i.e., Society 4.0, people have accessed data in cyber space via the Internet, to ana- lyze and make use of information and data. In Society 5.0, by contrast, large volumes of data will be transacted between physical space and cyber space with low latency and high reliability. This will enable anyone, at any time and any place, to access people, information, and things in a hyper-realistic manner, increasing people’s freedom in where and when to work. Already, the COVID-19 pandemic has made online meetings the norm in business, while real-time
music sessions can now be enjoyed in private. The fusion of physical space and cyber space is taking place. As this trans- formation progresses, some watchers predict that large amounts of data in the physical space will be sucked up into cyber space, where physical space will be recreated and hence the future is predicted. This will be fed back into phys- ical space, allowing people to make decisions on their next actions. Toward this end, data from a wide range of sensors in every location must be collected, analyzed, and fed back in an instant. 6G is the communications infrastructure that is expected to make this sort of society a reality.
6G is expected to enable communications not only on land but in the sky, at sea, and in every area, extending the coverage of communications. By comparison with 5G, numerical targets for the technology include 5 times the maximum communication speed (100 billion bits per sec- ond), 1/10 the latency (100 microseconds) and 10 times the simultaneous connectivity (10 million devices per km2). Targets have also been set for the effective utilization of frequencies, reduced power consumption, high-reliability, and high-speed mobility.

CTO Message
   Difference Between 5G and 6G
          Important technologies for achieving these numerical targets include the utilization of millimeter waves and tera- hertz waves, advances in space-time synchronization, full network virtualization, and all-optical networks. Each of these faces technical challenges. So far, multi-level modula- tion, MIMO and other forms of multiplexing, bandwidth broadening, and other technologies have been introduced to speed up communications. While each of these has room for improvement, bandwidth broadening in particular is essential to achieving speed of 100 billion bits/second. Doing so requires the availability of continuous usable fre- quencies. For example, to secure a continuous band of 10GHz, a frequency band of 100GHz or higher must be used. This raises the frequency beyond that of the millime- ter waves used in 5G, limiting communication area due to further shortening of communication range and a require- ment for higher linearity. Therefore, those such as improve- ment of massive MIMO technology, utilization of reflection
provided
to expand communication area are the important challeng- es that lie ahead. Applying higher frequency with measur- ing instrument is another challenge. Anritsu has committed itself to the study of millimeter wave measurement tech- nology. In 2019, we began research and development of technology beyond 5G, and in 2020, we launched new development of fundamental millimeter wave technology aimed at 6G. Anritsu will support the foundation of peo- ple’s lifestyles by supporting the development of communi- cations technology.

What is MEMS?
Tackling Basic Research for NEMS
As a medium- and long-term research theme, in April 2020 Anritsu began basic research aimed at making NEMS a reality. NEMS are devices with mechanical structures on the order of nanometers in size. Devices on a scale larger than NEMS are known as MEMS, or micromachines; these are used in smartphones, RF circuit switches, acceleration sen- sors for the detection of orientation and movement, pres- sure sensors, and more. Mechanical parts with the thickness of a human hair (50 micrometers) have already been put to practical use. NEMS devices are even smaller, enabling the detection of even more minute changes, down to the ability to sense a single molecule. NEMS also reduce power consumption through this miniaturization, and achieve higher sensitivity due to lower noise.
Making NEMS a reality will enable applications in a vast

range of fields, including biosensors for cancer and for viruses such as coronavirus, sensors for environmental mea- surements such as pollen, radiation, and carbon dioxide, and wearable devices. Great expectations have been placed on NEMS, but the need for even finer processing technology than that developed for MEMS has left NEMS technology to the future. The tremendous social and aca- demic significance promised by NEMS makes it a “dream” field of technology. Viewing NEMS as a technology for the future a dozen or so years ahead, Anritsu will undertake basic research to make this technology a reality.

  Market Environment and Business Opportunities
The Acceleration of Remote Social Activities
In 2019, 5G services were first launched in the U.S. and South Korea, and then in China, and now, many countries around the world are preparing for the full-fledged intro- duction of the services.
While human beings are experiencing hardships (COVID-19) on a global scale, it is notable that communications are being used to develop new lifestyle patterns. Sales and service activ- ities historically in form of face to face, are now moving online in many cases, and this trend expands to the education and healthcare fields. As social activities continue to become remote (a non-face-to face economy) going forward, it is pre- dicted that demand for communication methods that deliver high-definition video and image information will grow.
The Diversification of Information and
Communications Usage
Due to the recent trend that various social activities are done remotely, data traffic is rapidly increasing through those such as social media posting, video sharing, online meetings, and the like. As the practical use of services
such as 4K/8K video, event broadcasting with VR, and vari- ous IoT services, as represented by autonomous driving, are progressed there will be demand for higher-speed net- works. The issues apparent even in current networks, such as distorted screen images or delays, are expected to become even larger issues and therefore measurement technologies will become more sophisticated and more complicated in order to support telecommunications carri- ers, and communications device and equipment manufac- turers resolving those issues from quality aspect.
Aiming for a More Comfortable, High-Quality
Information Society
While more convenient and more comfortable environment is demanded for information and communication, 5G wire- less, 400Gbps wired ethernet, and various types of low-power wireless technologies are expected to be the

     ment, such as support and sales structures, so we can fur- ther enhance our partnerships with customers.
FY2019 Results
In FY2019, the second year of GLP2020, we achieved sales of ¥75.2 billion and an operating profit margin of 20%, signifi- cantly exceeding our initial forecasts of ¥69.0 billion for sales and an operating profit margin of 12%. The main factor behind this was our success in capturing demand for develop- ment related to the commercialization of 5G. In particular, our performance responding to the demand for the development of communications equipment supporting with 5G services launched specifically in Asia made a big contribution.
Initiatives for the Final Year of GLP2020
Based on the assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic which started at the end of FY2019 will have an impact on the first half of FY2020 and these effects will disappear in the second half of the year, we will work toward targets that will achieve GLP2020 and guide us into GLP2023.
These targets are sales of ¥77.0 billion and an operating profit margin of 20%. This fiscal year, we expect demand for conformance test related to 5G commercial services in addition to the 5G commercial development demand we engaged in FY2019. Also, as we expect demand to increase as the number of businesses launching these services grow, we will work on expanding our customer base. As 5G becomes more widespread, competition will most likely become fiercer, so we will focus on strengthening the com- petitiveness of related products. In addition to 5G, we will also actively invest in test solutions in areas including even higher-speed 400Gbps ethernet, cloud computing, and wireless LAN, while advancing product development that
supports large capacity and high speeds across entire com- munications networks.
Toward “Beyond 2020”
The features of 5G, namely ultra-low latency and multiple simultaneous connections, will make the use of information and communications technology possible in areas in which it was previously difficult to achieve, including in the automo- tive, healthcare, manufacturing, and construction industries. Many experiments and demonstrations are being conducted and we expect to see a variety of use cases being created. Anritsu is conducting initial verification activities with some leading service providers and manufacturing-related custom- ers, and we have started widening the scope of the areas in which we carry out activities in addition to currently focused smartphone-related fields. We will leverage the connecting and measuring technologies that are the core competencies of the Test and Measurement Company, with the aim of expanding our business in fields where 5G is used, through collaborations and M&A with customers that have a strong presence in other industries.
In regard to revenues, we will strengthen frameworks that support growth. Specifically, we will work on building initiatives such as improving the effectiveness of development costs by strengthening resource allocation to overseas development sites, expanding our customer base by adding more sales chan- nels (increasing revenue from new markets), building a flexible production structure that is not confined to areas where we have manufacturing sites (location-free production), and coor- dinating with suppliers to source key components from multiple

countries (avoiding procurement risk). In this way we will advance the optimization and streamlining of our overall operations.
In “Beyond 2020,” we aim to realize sales of ¥100.0 bil- lion and an operating profit margin of 20% through this series of initiatives.

Solving Social Issues Through Business
Description of Social Issues
Communication over Internet services such as social net- works, photo sharing, and video distribution, have become indispensable tools for “connecting” people with society. The communication network that realizes such “connec- tions” has evolved day by day, and now entering the 5G era that enables high-speed, large-capacity, ultra-low latency, and multiple simultaneous connections. 5G is expected to become a communications infrastructure that solves various social issues such as information disparity, traffic accident pre- vention, and labor shortages and realizes the sustainabile soci-
ety by being employed in industrial fields such as medical care, agriculture, automobiles, and disaster prevention in addi- tion to further sophisticate smartphones and tablet devices.
Anritsu Initiatives
The Test and Measurement Business provides added value by manufacturing original products at a high level, which corresponds to Goal 9 of the SDGs (Industry, innovation and infrastructure). We will also grow our contribution to Goal 11 (Sustainable cities and communities) by expanding our business in 5G including utilization by IoT. Furthermore, we will play our part in the Anritsu Group’s efforts to “resolve social issues as represented by the SDGs”, by realizing part- nerships with customers, developing environmentally friend- ly products, and strengthening overseas operations.
Societies with highly advanced information and commu- nications have potentials to solve a wide range of social issues including, for example, saving energy. Our measure- ment technologies will fulfill a role in making life more con- venient and ensuring comfort by raising the quality of communications networks. We will contribute to the cre- ation of sustainable society by making the maximum utili- zation of 5G and other technologies we own.

  deny the possibility of a global recession, from a medium- to long-term perspective the effects of the pandemic are advancing automation and labor-saving on production lines, so we expect that demand related to the quality assurance of foods and pharmaceuticals will grow going forward.
Looking at PQA markets by region, there is growing demand among consumers in Japan for foods that are safe, delicious, and easy to prepare, and major food companies are investing in building reliable quality assurance systems. Safe and secure quality assurance, such as traceability and food defense, is being applied across entire food supply chains.
In North America, primarily major food companies are continuing to introduce X-ray inspection systems, and in the meat market in particular, there is growing demand related to inspecting products for bone fragments. In Europe, which has the longest history of introducing quali- ty inspection and standardizing quality control criteria, demand for quality inspection remains stable.
In China and the ASEAN countries, the need for safe food is increasing with the expanded distribution of pre- packaged foods. Demand for quality inspections is expect- ed to increase, primarily among global food companies and leading regional manufacturers.
Growth Strategy
GLP2020 Basic Policy
In GLP2020, Anritsu positions the three years of the plan up until 2020 as a period of preparation for taking a leap forward as a “world-class quality assurance solution part- ner” who will become our customers’ “first call” company.
Through our basic policies of “developing global busi- ness,” “creating value for customers through quality assur-
ance solutions,” and “collaborating and growing together with leading customers (envision : ensure)” we aim to achieve 2020VISION and continue realizing continuous growth with sustainable superior profits.
In order to realize this goal, we are “cultivating markets in advanced countries in Europe and the Americas and the pharmaceutical manufacturing market, with X-ray inspec- tion systems as a key solution” and “responding adequate- ly to market needs through localization and transforming into a global business.”
Fiscal Year 2019 Review
Up to the end of last year, the market environment was rel- atively good, and we received a steady stream of orders. However, due to the trend the time between delivery and acceptance by the customers becoming longer, sales were slow compared to orders. Also, competition in overseas markets was intensifying, and there were notable cases where customers decided not to choose our products due to the lead time between order and delivery.
In order to respond to this situation and put the business back on a sustainable growth track, in the North American region we built a structure that can flexibly supply a range of different products in combinations that match up with cus- tomer demands by storing modular units locally. This greatly improved the lead times for delivering products to customers.
Also, in order to improve profitability and raise the added value of the business, we are focusing on acquiring automation technologies such as artificial intelligence, sig- nal processing, and robotic delivery, as well as developing solutions specifically for target markets. The main new products launched in FY2019 are as follows.
• The KXE7522 X-Ray Inspection System with Dual Energy Sensor, which improves sanitation, for the poultry market
The weight inspection is designed to determine whether the items have been weighed properly and are correctly packaged. At the contaminant inspection stage, verification of whether there are metal or plastic contents is conducted and X-ray inspection equipment can detect cracks and defects in such products as cookies. In addition, the production management software “QUICCA” may collaborate in the inspection and weighting stages to monitor production.

 Initiatives for the Final Year of GLP2020
In FY2020, due to business performance in the previous fiscal year and the recent external environment becoming severer, we think it will be hardly feasible to achieve the GLP2020 tar- gets of ¥26.0 billion in segment sales and ¥3.0 billion in oper- ating profit. Although it was a difficult decision, we have revised our results forecast downward to ¥24.0 billion in seg- ment sales and ¥1.8 billion in operating profit.
Currently we are aiming for continuous growth with sus- tainable superior profits while taking sufficient care that employees and customers are protected from catching COVID-19, and we will advance structural reforms to turn us into a global and highly profitable business.
As a company that is involved in the food industry, we will continue to provide maintenance services to customers who are struggling daily to realize stable food supplies while focusing on strengthening sales promotion methods that are alternatives to face-to-face sales and providing information through means such as online product intro- duction sessions and seminars, and e-mail newsletters.

Solving Social Issues through Business
Description of Social Issues
Through the use of food processing technology that raises the storage life of perishables, our daily lifestyles have undergone rapid advances in the modern era. Instead of buying ingredi- ents and preparing meals at home, food is now distributed as a packaged product that has greatly improved convenience and plentifulness in people’s lives. Once food is distributed in large quantities, however, uneaten food is thrown away (i.e., food loss) in increasing amounts, a social problem that has drawn attention lately. SDG Target 12.3 is stated as “Halve per capital global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains,
including post-harvest losses,” a clearly stated objective to ensure a sustainable food consumption and production pat- tern. Today, most food processing companies have identified the reduction of food loss as a major issue alongside guaran- teeing the deliciousness, safety and security of their products.
Anritsu Initiatives
At food processing plants, factory automation has facilitated the faster processing of food in larger amounts for shipment. It is necessary to inspect each individual product to ensure
processed food is safe and reliable. In the past, a large num- ber of workers were used in the food inspection process to examine the food before shipment. However, inspections by people are subject to issues related to differences in individual skills and fatigue causing people to lose their concentration.
Along with providing solutions for automating the quali- ty inspection process on food production lines, Anritsu aims to provide solutions linked to minimizing food loss. Together with customers, the Company will continue to provide advanced quality assurance solutions with the aim of contributing to the realization of a sustainable society with little food loss, and a society where anyone can live their lives in safety without worry.

 Anritsu has always employed an advanced corporate governance structure. The Company introduced an executive officer system in 2000. Also, as part of its thorough approach to IR, Anritsu established an IR Department in 2001 to conduct engagement with the market. In 2004, the Company acted ahead of other companies to establish a Compensation Advisory Committee that later became the Compensation Committee, and in 2005 invited outside directors. In 2015, Anritsu opted to become a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee. This early adoption made Anritsu the second listed company to do so.
This series of actions went well beyond the movement to strengthen corporate governance that accelerated in Japanese companies from 2014.

Corporate Governance
    Basic Concept on Corporate Governance
By flexibly and speedily responding to changes in the business environment and enhancing Anritsu’s competitiveness as a global company, the Company aims to achieve continuous growth with sustainable superior profits, as well as increases in corporate value over the medium- to long-term.
Throughout the process, the Company will maintain an awareness of the duties it bears toward shareholders, employ- ees, clients, business partners, creditors, local communities, and other diverse stakeholders. Furthermore, with the goals of transparent, fair, speedy, and resolute decision-making and appropriate and timely information disclosure, the Company will maintain a structure and frameworks for corporate gover- nance and will work continually toward the advancement and enhancement of them.
Board of Directors
As a management decision-making body, the Board of Directors makes determinations on important matters including manage- ment policy and management strategy for the Group as a whole, while also monitoring and supervising the execution of operations by organizations that execute business.
The Company has strengthened the monitoring and supervision functions of the Board of Directors through the inclusion of multi- ple outside directors into the board. In Board of Directors’ meet- ings, directors who possess wide-ranging knowledge and experience express opinions regarding agenda items proposed by company management from their respective viewpoints and engage in active discussion. The current Board of Directors consists of five internal directors and four outside directors (with both groups including directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee members), for a total of nine Board of Directors members.
Methods for Evaluating the Efficacy of the
Board of Directors
Every year, the Company conducts a review of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors with respect to items specified in the Basic Policy on Corporate Governance, and undertakes measures

Corporate Governance Structure
As its structure for corporate governance, the Company has adopted the structure of a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee and has set up a Board of Directors, Audit & Supervisory Committee, and Accounting Auditor, with the aim of further strengthening audit and supervisory functions.
As part of a highly specialized manufacturing industry that calls for on-site-oriented sensibilities and swiftness in business execution, the Company has introduced an executive officer system and has separated the decision-making and oversight functions of the Board of Directors from the business execu- tion functions of executive officers.
The Board of Directors is composed of nine directors, five of whom are not involved in business execution (with four of the five being independent outside directors). Of note, the atten- dance rate of outside directors at Board of Directors meetings in FY2019 was 100%.
to improve effectiveness. This evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors takes place over the span of four to five months every year, progressing from reaffirmation of issues from the previous fiscal year to evaluation of the status of actions and the degree of improvement. This is followed by discussions of whether any points in the previous year’s evaluation methods or evaluation items should be changed for the current fiscal year. The discussion is deepened through exchanges of opinions within the Board of Directors, where issues are shared, and the out- comes are connected to initiatives for the following year.
Results of Evaluating the Efficacy of the Board
of Directors
Every year, the Board of Directors carries out an analysis and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, based on factors including self-assessments by directors. The main results of evaluation of FY2019 are as follows.
The Board of Directors of the Company affirmed that its compo- sition is appropriate in terms of the presence and number of inter- nal and outside management personnel. This is to enhance the Company’s global management structure with the aim of business expansion and taking into account the source of the Group’s cor- porate value. It also affirmed that structures are in place for con- ducting constructive discussions and decision-making concerning key matters involving the management of the Group and for supervising business execution by directors. The board further con- firmed that directors who are constituent members of the Board of Directors, Audit & Supervisory Committee, Independent Committee, Nominating Committee, and Compensation Committee fully understand the roles that they should carry out to achieve improvement of corporate value and continuous growth with sustainable superior profits for the Group, and that, in respec- tive committee meetings, the directors display insight and expert knowledge based on diverse experience and that all, internal and outside directors alike, engage in active discussions.
Conversely, issues identified for further enhancement of effec- tiveness include increasing the number of opportunities to hear

   System of Officer Compensation
Under the policy stated below, the composition and level of officer compensation, etc. are determined with reference to data on officer compensation from external research organiza- tions, while also taking into account a balance between basic compensation according to responsibilities and perfor- mance-linked compensation, with the primary aim of compen- sation to function effectively as an incentive for the improvement of business performance and the increase of medium- to long-term corporate value every fiscal year.
• The scheme and its content should lead to the enhancement of motivation to achieve management objectives and sus- tainably improve corporate value
• The scheme and its content should attract and retain talent- ed, diverse personnel who are sought after as officers of global corporations.
• The Company will ensure the validity and objectivity of the decision-making process and the balanced allocation of compensation, etc.
The current scheme for officer compensation, etc. sets busi- ness performance-linked compensation to the equivalent of
Compensation, etc. of Directors
50% of the basic compensation, as a structural feature to motivate officers in sharing a profit orientation with share- holders and in engaging in management from an awareness of performance and stock price from a medium- to long-term perspective. However, it limits directors who do not engage in execution of business (including outside directors) to fixed compensation only.
The performance-linked compensation is composed of mon- etary compensation (bonus equivalent to 30% of basic com- pensation) and non-monetary compensation (stock compensation equivalent to 20% of basic compensation) through an incentive plan employing trusts – i.e., it consists of a bonus as short-term performance-linked compensation and stock compensation as medium- to long-term perfor- mance-linked compensation.
The Company conducts evaluations in light of factors including the level of distribution of surpluses for the fiscal year under evalua- tion, degree of achievement of numerical targets involving man- agement metrics, and degree of achievement of management objectives that include non-financial perspectives set in advance.

Three-Way Discussion: President and Outside Directors
           Takaya Seki Hirokazu Hamada Kazuyoshi Aoki
Outside Director Representative Director, Outside Director President of Anritsu
Group CEO
Outside Director Takaya Seki and Outside Director Kazuyoshi Aoki, who have deep knowledge of global business, and President Hirokazu Hamada exchanged thoughts on the current business situa- tion and issues in order to improve the effectiveness of governance as the Anritsu Group expands its business globally. The discussion was carried out in remote format in July 2020.
   Hamada: Thank you for making time for this discussion in your busy schedule. Given the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will hold our exchange of ideas in remote for- mat. Regarding the pandemic, we set the lives of employees as our highest priority and moved very quickly taking actions such as recalling of staff stationed overseas. In the end, our actions were by no means too early. Through the experience, we affirmed the importance of thinking one step ahead in our actions to avoid risks in terms of both safety and business.
Aoki: The Company’s response to the pandemic, including the adoption of telecommuting, was surprisingly quick. From the standpoint of maximum efficiency in employees’ work, how- ever, there is still a need to review work styles.
Hamada: We looked at telecommuting as the ideal way of working, but its mental impacts to employees are still uncer- tain, and a number of problems remain to appear. Appraising employee output under telecommuting is also an issue, which we will address through further review.
Seki: The proliferation of telecommuting could present a busi- ness opportunity for the Company, and spurring of new ways
of working has expanded its potential even further. I hope that the Company will make full use of this experience to connect it to further development in the future, following the principle of using concern in a crisis to motivate us to prepare.
Aoki: We have kept the impacts of the virus on the Company to a minimum, but we need to continue checking risks with- out failing.
Hamada: That is absolutely right. Communicating with cus- tomers has become difficult, but I want to keep assessing the situation and handle it appropriately.
Global Corporate Group Governance and Financial Management
Hamada: It is my intention to follow the opinions of our Outside Directors, and do my best to incorporate them into our management. Your sincere opinions on governance in the Group management are appreciated.

Seki: The most important responsibility that we Directors carry is the proper management of corporate assets. As Group companies themselves are investment assets of the Company, we have to manage Group companies as a single entity.
Aoki: A global company should achieve management that commits to high ethical standards and a spirit of legal compli- ance in every country and region, and all of a global compa- ny’s domestic and foreign subsidiaries have to be operated under the leadership of the company. Toward that end, three principles are important: “sublime ideas,” “organizations to support activities,” and “monitoring.”
What matters here is unifying funds through means includ- ing the introduction of global cash management, and being mindful of capital costs. Thinking from this point, I support the use of ACE (Anritsu Capital-cost Evaluation: Net operating profit after tax – Cost of capital (5%)) as the Company’s busi- ness management metric.
Hamada: Regarding the management of overseas Group companies, this is something that we have struggled with for a long time, making step-by-step progress through trial and error. Thus far, we have emphasized face-to-face communica- tion as important but the pandemic has made it difficult. We will have to proceed through trial and error to find out how to make governance work from here on out.
Aoki: I recognize that the Company has established good communications with our overseas subsidiaries. The current situation is not perfect however, I look forward to further refinement.
Seki: In management of the Group, how to balance the cen- tralization and decentralization of authority to maximize syner- gies will be a key issue. Looking at the Company’s choice of “Global Headquarters Building” as the name of the new head office building completed in 2015, I can feel the willingness that we will improve governance as a global company.
The Progress of Technology and the Company’s Business
Hamada: Our Company has a history of 125 years, and it is still important that we continue pursuing cutting-edge tech- nology. It is a natural thing to concentrate on current business, but I want the Company to build up technology with an eye to the future.
Seki: The rapid progress of technology represents not only business opportunities but risks as well. It is important that we engage organically in activities while we formulate a strategy that views our businesses as a portfolio, construct a defense line to ensure the efficacy of internal control, and remain mindful of the efficacy of corporate governance in headquarters.
Aoki: Regardless the size of a company, evolution of technolo- gies can mean great opportunities. It is necessary to pull the whole Company in a direction of seeking to create true tech- nological innovation. We have to invest management resourc- es under a clear division between technological innovation, for refining existing products, and technological innovation, for the purpose of new businesses.
The Aims of Anritsu’s Group Management
Hamada: There’s a lot more to be said, but to wrap things up, please tell me about the Group’s future goals from here on out.
Aoki: The mission of a company is to increase corporate value over the medium- to long-term. From the premise that a com- pany must satisfy all of its stakeholders, the shareholders who receive the final distribution of profits must be satisfied as well. It is important to meet the expectations of shareholders while valuing every stakeholder, such as for example, provid- ing customers with high-quality services and providing employees with comfortable workplaces.
Seki: I agree with that. Five years ago, the Company adopted the structure of a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee, to build an agile execution structure and strength- en supervisory functions. Under this structure, the manage- ment team has to demonstrate abilities in order for stakeholders to receive maximum benefits. I also believe that our relationships with local communities are important. We should take pride in the trust that we enjoy from communities, and I hope that we can continue building good relationships.
Hamada: Without the trust of stakeholders, our measuring instruments and other products will not earn the trust of the society. We want our Company to be one that carries out its responsibilities and contributes to the future through business while never pursuing improper gains. We will continue acting with “Sincerity, Harmony, and Enthusiasm,” as set out in our Company philosophy, and will aim to remain a Company that is needed by society and a Company that aids in creating a better future.

ESG Highlights
Tackling Climate Change
Targeting About 30% Private Generation of Renewable Energy through Anritsu Climate Change Action PGRE 30
Anritsu Corporation has formulated “Anritsu Climate Change Action PGRE 30 (hereinafter “PGRE 30”*1)” as a new initiative for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. PGRE 30 will directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the use of renewable energy. Private generation of renew- able energy ratio accounted for 0.8% of the Anritsu Group’s electricity consumption*2 in FY2018 and we will raise this to about 30% by around 2030.
In FY2019, due to the addition of 57kW of solar panels in the Atsugi premises in January 2020 the ratio of private power generation reached 0.9%. In September 2020, 1,100 kW of solar panels will be installed in the United States and as a result, in FY2020 the private power genera- tion ratio is expected to be 4.3%.
PGRE 30 is Anritsu’s ambitious attempt to exceed Ja- pan’s 2030 renewable energy target of 22% to 24% (7% of which is from solar generation).
Target 7.2 in Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promotes increasing substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. PGRE 30 is Anritsu’s own unique contribution to directly expand- ing the use of renewable energy by introducing the solar
U.S. We believe this initiative will help to achieve the goals and targets in the SDGs.
Background to the Approach
As a countermeasure to the problems of climate change and man-made global warming, the Paris Agreement (COP21) was formulated in 2015 with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that the rise in average temperatures does not exceed 2°C compared to pre-indus- trial levels. This approach was set as a key issue within the SDGs adopted by the UN that same year.
Anritsu submitted its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the Science-Based Target (SBT) initiative*3 and it was approved in December 2019 as a plan matching pro- posed reduction scenarios based on IPCC*4 climate science.
The Anritsu Group’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets that received SBT approval are as follows.
• Scope 1 & 2: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30%
compared to FY2015 levels by FY2030
• Scope 3: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions connected to
the use of products and services purchased and products sold by 30% compared to FY2018 levels by FY2030
Although the purchase of renewable energy credits/cer- tificates (RECs) was also considered for implementing this plan, we formulated PGRE 30 with a focus on generating renewable energy in-house as part of our initiatives for realizing the SDGs.
*1 PGRE 30: “PGRE” refers to Private Generation of Renewable Energy and “30” refers to the target of 30% Private Generation of Renewable Energy by around 2030.
*2 Electricity consumption of AT Techmac Co., Ltd. is excluded because it is not a whol- ly-owned subsidiary.

A joint initiative encouraging companies to set reduction targets that are in line with scientific knowledge to ensure that the rise in average temperatures does not exceed 2°C, or if possible 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels.

Harmonizing with Global Society
Social Issues as a Background
The Anritsu Group supports the universal principles of human rights and labor. Since 2006, we have participated in the United Nations Global Compact, which puts these principles into prac- tice. As a signatory dedicated to solving social issues—including the SDGs—we are promoting efforts aimed at advancing respect for human rights and diversity. In order to better secure human resources in an aging society with a declining birth rate, and to respond to the risks and needs of a diversifying market, we believe it is increasingly important for companies to pro- mote diversity management. For the Anritsu Group, which has overseas sales that account for 66% of total sales, fulfilling our long-term vision of remaining the leader in the global market, while also maintaining our current business activities, requires us to create an environment in which a diverse group of employees can work actively and mutually share their values.
Anritsu’s Human Resources Concept
In the Anritsu Group, human resources are an essential asset. We believe that supporting diverse human resources innovation and solving social issues through our business will lead to greater corpo- rate value. Recognizing this, we announced a Diversity Policy and have promoted diversity through measures including gender equali- ty; supporting the active involvement of female employees; promot- ing a healthy life-work balance; encouraging the hiring of employees with disabilities; hiring foreign employees; supporting the involvement of senior employees and more. We are energetically striving to support diversity by hiring and promoting diverse human resources and adopting a global human resources management sys- tem. Also, the Anritsu Group is pursuing reforms to the labor envi- ronment and labor system for life-work balance of the employees.
Promoting the Active Involvement of Female Employees
We are carrying out initiatives to allow female employees to pursue their professional lives alongside their private lives and to more directly contribute to the growth of our business and enhancement of our corporate value. We are putting particular effort toward career development and support for female employees who have difficulty balancing work and home demands due to life events such as childrearing or family nursing care. In FY2016, we set the goal of raising the ratio of women hired in Japan to 20% of all
For additional information, please see the Anritsu Sustainability Report 2020.
new recruits by 2020, while also further establishing a working environment that supports female employees. In April 2020, we achieved this goal. In terms of support for career advancement, we also have initiatives such as increasing the number of participants in our tier-based training system as well as training seminars that have helped three female employees in FY2019 became company man- agers. As a result, our ratio of female managers in FY2019 was 1.8%. In April of 2020, two female employees became company managers. Going forward, we have announced a new goal, which we would like to achieve by FY2023, to surpass the June, 2020 industry average of a 3.3% ratio* of women in management posi- tions. Accordingly, we will devote continued effort to increasing our number of female employees, supporting career development for females, and creating an environment that fosters female employees who take on central roles in the organization.

Work-Style Reform Initiatives
The Anritsu Group moved quickly and took early steps to pro- mote work-style reforms to respond to the social demands such as responses for aging society with a declining birth rate, life- work balance and globalization. We are promoting telecommut- ing that helps free employees from working in a specific place at a specific time while supporting workstyles that suit different val- ues of employees and approaches to work. Also, the Anritsu Group is pursuing reforms to the labor environment and labor system, and working to spur innovation by improving productivi- ty, all as part of work-style reforms with the goal of translating these changes to greater corporate value.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The Anritsu Group has adopted IFRS since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 and prepared consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS in FY2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.
   The Scope of Consolidation
The Anritsu Group comprised 45 consolidated subsidiaries and one affiliate at the end of FY2019.
Overview
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the global economy had been continuing to grow at a modest pace, especially in developed countries, despite the heating up of the US-China trade friction. However, the global spread of COVID-19 caused a halt to economic activity, plunging the world in to an economic recession. Moreover, there are con- cerns that the spread of COVID-19 may have further nega- tive impacts on business activities, including disruption of supply chains due to restrictions on the movement of goods and people, shutdowns of factory operations and closure of business locations due to city lockdowns and other measures.
Domestic demand has fallen precipitously in Japan as well, due to factors such as falling inbound demand, can- cellation of events, and people refraining from eating out and other activities.
In the field of information and communication, mobile broadband services are growing both in terms of quality and volume, and the volume of mobile data transmission is increasing rapidly which pressures the capacity of network infrastructure. In order to solve these issues, 4G mobile communications system has evolved continually to become LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and LTE-Advanced, and then LTE- Advanced Pro (Gigabit LTE). In addition, specification devel- opment of the next-generation 5G communications system is proceeding in 3GPP. The standardization of 5G NSA-NR (Non-Standalone New Radio) finished in December, 2017 and the one of 5G SA-NR (Standalone New Radio) finished in June, 2018. All specifications of 5G main functions that are related to ultra-high speed communication are set. Continuously among 3GPP, specification development of ultra-low latency communications and multiple simultane- ous connections for expansion of use case (Release 16*) is under consideration and the standardization will be expect- ed to be finished in 2020. In addition, new specifications (Release 17*) for contributing to improved 5G efficiency and capability, such as expansion of high-frequency range, expansion of communication area, low-power consump- tion, and low-cost communication are under cousideration at 3GPP, and the standardization will be targeted to be fin-
ished in 2021.
As a result, 5G services were launched in the US, Korea,
Europe, and China, and the 5G commercialization sched- ules of operators in each country are smoothly making progress. In Japan as well, 5G services were
launched in certain areas, centered on cities, in March 2020.
Amid such environment, the Test and Measurement Business Group has focused on solution development to serve 5G investment demand as well as strengthening the organization structure. Consequently, the Test and Measurement Business Group captured development demand for 5G chipsets and devices.
In the field of PQA (Product Quality Assurance), auto- mation investment on processed foods production lines is underway, and demand is growing steadily for contami- nant inspection using X-rays and quality assurance toward packaging. Amid such environment, the PQA Group has worked to reinforce the competitiveness of its solutions focused on X-rays, as well as enhance and expand its global sales structure.

Revenue
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, development demand for 5G chipsets and mobile devices was growing steadily. Particularly in Asia, development demands aimed at 5G commercialization grew, driving the 5G business. Consequently, revenue and profit in the Test and Measurement segment increased compared with the previ- ous fiscal year. In the Products Quality Assurance segment during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the food product market, as well as the demand for capital invest- ment with the purpose of automating, labor saving, and strengthening quality assurance processes were growing steadily both in Japan and overseas. However, due to pro- longed product acceptance inspection at customers’ sites, the revenue was lower than the previous fiscal year.
As a result, orders increased 6.8% compared with the previous fiscal year to ¥107,709 million , and revenue increased 7.4% compared with the previous fiscal year to ¥107,023 million. Operating profit increased 54.8% com- pared with the previous fiscal year to ¥17,413 million, prof- it before tax increased 51.2% compared with the previous fiscal year to ¥17,181 million. Profit increased 49.0% com-

For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, Anritsu plans to pay cash dividends of ¥31 per share (including an interim dividend of ¥15.5 per share).
Business Segments
The Anritsu Group classifies its operations into the seg- ments of Test and Measurement, Products Quality Assurance, and Others. In order to evaluate each business segment more appropriately, the headquarter administra- tive expenses portion of general and administrative expens- es for each business segment has been shifted to be included in company-wide expenses starting from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. These expenses from the pre- vious fiscal year have been restated.
Test and Measurement
This segment develops, manufactures and sells a variety of communication and general purpose measuring instruments, test systems and service assurances for telecommunication carriers, communication equipment manufacturers as well as maintenance and installation companies around the world.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, develop- ment demand for 5G chipsets and mobile devices were growing steadily. Particularly in Asia, development demands
aimed at 5G commercialization grew and became the driver of the 5G business. Consequently, segment revenue increased 10.3% compared with the previous fiscal year to ¥75,165 million, operating profit increased 60.9% to ¥15,148 million and adjusted operating profit increased 59.6% to ¥15,018 million.
* Adjusted operating profit is Anritsu’s original profit indicator to measure results of its recurring business by excluding profit and loss items with a transient nature from operat- ing profit.
The Test and Measurement Business, which accounts for 70% of the Anritsu Group’s revenue, is divided into the fol- lowing 3 sub-segments
1. Mobile
The Mobile sub-segment includes measuring instruments for mobile phone acceptance testing by mobile phone ser- vice providers, and measuring instruments for design, pro- duction, function and performance verification, and maintenance of mobile handsets by manufacturers of mobile devices such as smartphones, IC chipsets and rele- vant components.
Demand in this sub-segment tends to be influenced by factors including the technological innovations in mobile phone services, market penetration, number of new sub- scribers as well as new entries in and withdrawals from the market by mobile phone and chipset manufacturers, and the number of model changes and shipments of mobile phones and chipsets.
LTE, which has been deployed throughout the world, has evolved into LTE-Advanced and LTE-Advanced Pro in order to relieve the pressure on capacity of network infrastructure from the rapid surge in data communication traffic. Currently, the specifications related to ultra-high speed com- munication of next-generation 5G communication systems are set, and the commercialization of 5G is being advanced by operators from various countries, starting in the US, Korea, Europe, and then in China and Japan. While manu- facturing demand for the LTE smartphones has declined in the mobile phone-manufacturing market, development of IC chipsets and mobile phones supporting 5G has taken off full steam in the mobile phone-development market, and demand for measuring instruments for 5G development is growing. In addition, the specifications related to ultra-low latency communications and multiple simultaneous connec-

As a result, segment revenue increased 10.3% compared with the previous fiscal year to ¥9,282 million, and operating profit increased 65.9% compared with the previous fiscal year to ¥1,900 million.
Liquidity and Financial Condition
Fund Procurement and Liquidity Management
The Anritsu Group’s funding requirements are mainly for working capital to purchase materials and cover expenses incurred in the manufacturing, sales and marketing of products; for capital investments; and for research and development expenses. The Group secures sufficient fund- ing to cover these requirements from retained earnings, bank borrowings, and capital market funding. To ensure stability in funding, the Anritsu Group arranged for a com- mitment line of ¥7.5 billion in March 2020, which is effec- tive through March 2023. Looking forward, while preparing for unforeseen financial risks, both domestic and overseas, in a dramatically changing market environment, the Anritsu Group will swiftly and flexibly meet its capital requirements for working capital, regular repayment of long-term bor- rowings and business growth.
As of March 31, 2020, the balance of interest-bearing debt was ¥14,594 million (compared with ¥16,435 million at the end of the previous fiscal year) and the debt-to-equi- ty ratio was 0.15 (compared with 0.19 at the end of the previous fiscal year). And the net debt-to-equity ratio was negative 0.35 (compared with negative 0.33 at the end of the previous fiscal year). In addition, the average turnover ratio on the end-of-period balance of inventories to reve- nue was 5.4 times.
The Company will utilize increased cash flow generated by improvements in ACE (achievement of net operating profit after tax less an adjustment for the cost of capital) and CCC as well as enhanced capital efficiency resulting from measures including an internal group cash manage- ment system to make further reductions in interest-bearing debt, improve the debt-to-equity ratio, enhancing share- holders’ equity and fortify its financial structure.
At the end of March 2020, Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I) has rated Anritsu’s short-term debt [a-1], and its long-term debt [A-]. Anritsu will continue working to enhance its financial stability in order to improve its debt rating.

Cash Flow
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents (hereafter, “net cash”) increased ¥2,572 million compared with the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥47,669 million.
Free cash flow, the sum of cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from investing activities, was posi- tive ¥11,035 million (compared with positive ¥11,631 mil- lion in the previous fiscal year).
Conditions and factors for each category of cash flow for the fiscal year were as follows.
• Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was ¥14,721 mil- lion (in the previous fiscal year, operating activities provided net cash of ¥12,247 million).
The cash increase was due to reporting of profit before tax and recording depreciation and amortization, on the other hand, the cash decrease was mainly due to increase in inventories, trade and other receivables. Depreciation and amortization expense was ¥4,999 million (increase of ¥612 million compared with the same period of the previ- ous fiscal year).
• Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was ¥3,686 million (in the previous fiscal year, investing activities used net cash of ¥616 million). The cash decrease was mainly due to acquisi- tion of property, plant and equipment.
• Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was ¥7,592 million (in the previous fiscal year, financing activities used net cash of ¥2,052 million). The primary reason was repayments of long-term borrowings ¥3,500 million and payment of cash dividends totaling ¥3,365 million (in the previous fiscal year, cash dividends was ¥2,198 million).
Assets, Liabilities, and Equity
Assets increased ¥8,405 million compared with the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥138,873 million. This was main- ly due to increase of cash and cash equivalents, as well as inventories. Total liabilities decreased ¥247 million com- pared with the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥44,541 million. This was mainly due to decrease of bonds and bor- rowings. On the other hand, other financial liabilities
increased due to the increase of lease liabilities by the adoption of IFRS16.Equity increased ¥8,653 million com- pared with the end of the previous fiscal year to ¥94,331 million. This was mainly due to increase of retained earn- ings, while decrease of other components of equity. As a result, the equity attributable to owners of parent to total assets ratio was 67.8%, compared with 65.6% at the end of the previous fiscal year.

For the Products Quality Assurance segment, revenue is expected to increase in the PQA Business, both in the Japanese and overseas markets. Operating profit is also expected to increase compared with the previous fiscal year.
The Anritsu Group will strive to establish a competitive advantage in the mobile market by offering timely solutions that accurately meet the needs of 5G commercialization plans in countries worldwide and be a leading company supporting 5G and IoT society.
Risk Information
Policies and Systems
The Company views risks as indeterminate factors that may impact its corporate value, such as the organization’s profits and the trust of society (risk is not necessarily a negative factor for a company; it could be a positive factor if man- aged appropriately). The Company recognizes that manag- ing risk appropriately means that risk is a critically important management challenge, and has established Group-level systems to manage it. Moreover, in order to maintain and increase our corporate value, fulfill our corporate social responsibility, and pursue sustainable development of Anritsu Group, the Company focuses on making manage-
ment as well as all employees more sensitive to risk, and on all-hands initiatives that promote risk management.
Under the risk-management supervision of the Group CEO, the Anritsu Group designates a risk management offi- cer for each of the following recognized major risks: (1) business risk related to management decision-making and business execution; (2) risk of legal violations; (3) environ- mental risk; (4) risk to the quality of products and services; (5) import/export management risk; (6) information security risk; and (7) disaster risk. Each risk management officer heads a committee, consisting of representatives from Company departments and Group companies managers relevant to the risk in question. Each risk management office oversees the management of its designated risk for the Group as a whole; and reports the status of risk man- agement measures, plans and operation and the results of the year-round management cycle to the Management Strategy Conference as appropriate. In addition, the Risk Management Promotion Department leads such matters as creation of regulations and guidelines as well as training and education, and establishes systems necessary to raise the bar of risk management in order to ensure the sustain- able development of the business. Each risk management officer supports the activities of Group companies overseas for their responsible field respectively. With regard to com- pliance risk, the compliance officer of each regional head- quarters performs risk assessments and prepares and acts on an annual plan.
(Individual Risks)
1. Inherent Risks in the Anritsu Group’s
Technology and Marketing Strategies (1) busi-
ness risk
The Anritsu Group works to deploy its well-developed tech- nological capabilities to promptly provide cutting-edge products and services that offer value to customers. However, the rapid pace of technological innovation in the Anritsu Group’s core information and communication mar- kets and the Anritsu Group’s ability to deliver products and services in a timely manner to meet the needs and wants of customers are factors that have the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and operating results.

2. Market Fluctuation Risk (1) business risk
External factors including changes in the economy or mar- ket conditions and technological innovation affect the prof- itability of product lines the Group develops and have the potential to exert a significant material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and operating results.
Because a high percentage of Test and Measurement segment revenue comes from the telecommunications mar- ket, capital investment trends among service providers, net- work equipment manufacturers, mobile phone manufacturers, and electronic component manufacturers have the potential to exert an effect on business results. Telecom operators make a cost-effective capital investment in order to adopt technologies to handle rapid increases in data traffic, and to build networks that meets the various needs of IoT service and cloud service. Moreover, business results for the mobile communications measuring instru- ment field, the cornerstone of earnings for the Anritsu Group, are affected by changes in technological innovation in mobile phone services, the number of subscribers and the replacement ratio for smartphones.
In the Products Quality Assurance Business, sales to food manufacturers constitute more than 80% of revenue. Capital investment of food manufacturers may influence the perfor- mance of Products Quality Assurance Business potentially.
3. Global Business Development Risk (1) busi- ness risk, (2) risk of legal violations, and (5) import/export management risk
The Anritsu Group markets its products globally. The over- seas sales ratio is 66%, and many customers likewise oper- ate on a global scale. As a result, economic trends in countries worldwide, changes in international conditions, compliance with required laws have a potential to exert a material impact on the Group’s financial position and results of operations.
4. Risk of Spread of Infectious Diseases (7) disas- ter risk
The spread of COVID-19 is continuing. The Anritsu Group places top priority on ensuring the safety of its employees, and halting the spread of the virus internally and externally to the Anritsu Group. The Anritsu Group has also estab-
lished a COVID-19 Task Force, which is collecting informa- tion and taking necessary measures in order to minimize the virus’s impact on its operations. However, depending on how the spread of COVID-19 progresses, it has the poten- tial to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s finan- cial condition and operating results, due to the disruption of supply chains, and restrictions on business activities of the Group, its customers, and its suppliers, including the halt of factory operations and business location closures.
5. Disaster Risk (7) disaster risk
The Anritsu Group carries out production and sales activities globally. As such, natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons, and climate change-induced abnormal weather events induced by climate change, as well as fire, war, terror- ism, riots, and other events have the potential to exert a mate- rial impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and operation results by impeding our business activities due to impact on the major facilities of the Group, its suppliers, or its customers, or by causing political or economic instability.
Each division of the Anritsu Group has created a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) aimed at ensuring the smooth conti- nuity of our businesses by minimizing the damage from disasters and emergencies, and fast recovery of business activities. The Koriyama Office of Tohoku Anritsu Co., Ltd., which is a Group manufacturing facility, has created a BCP for natural disasters, including river flooding due to earth- quakes and torrential rains, as one of its major risks. This BCP clearly defines the actions to take after a natural disas- ter, broken up into specific processes. Taking the lessons learned from actual largescale disasters, the Company is reviewing the criteria for emergency BCP activation to pre- pare for a wider range of risks and refine the response pro- cedures when each risk occurs.
6. Foreign Exchange Risk (1) business risk
The Anritsu Group hedges foreign exchange risk using instruments including forward foreign exchange contracts for foreign exchange transactions that occur upon collec- tion of accounts receivable and other events. However, rapid changes in foreign exchange rates have the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and operating results.

   7. Long-Term Inventory Obsolescence Risk (1) business risk
The Anritsu Group works to provide products and services that precisely meet customer needs and wants. However, particularly in the Test and Measurement Instruments mar- ket, product lines are subject to frequent changes in order to follow technology evolution, which can easily result in obsolescence of products and parts, and could cause inven- tory to be held for long periods to lose its value. These fac- tors have the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and operating results.
8. Human Resource Acquisition Risk (1) business risk
Acquiring, ensuring, and developing human resources are the very important requirements for the sustainable devel- opment of the Anritsu Group. The Anritsu Group strives to acquire talented human resources by actively hiring diverse human resources without regard to nationality, gender or other natures and focuses on their development with efforts to enhance its internal training and education programs. The Anritsu Group also focuses on work-life balance, and strives to create working environments that support diverse work styles and values. However, if human resource acquisi- tion and development do not proceed as planned, it has the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and operating results.
9. Compliance Risk (2) risk of legal violations
The Anritsu Group is subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which it conducts business. Violation of these laws and regulations, or actions that violate the demands of society, has the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and oper- ating results through factors including legal punishment, lawsuits, social sanctions, and damage to the brand.
The Anritsu Group has established the Anritsu Group Code of Conduct, which serves as a guide for the conduct to take in order for us to fulfill our social responsibility. The Company also carries out educational and awareness-rais- ing activities as needed, as it strives to improve its corporate ethics and strengthen legal compliance. The Group CEO, who chairs the Management Strategy Conference, leads the promotion of compliance of the Domestic Anritsu
Group. Additionally, the Corporate Ethics Promotion Committee, chaired by the executive officer in charge of compliance, operates under the supervision of Management Strategy Conference, and oversees the compliance-promo- tion activities of each company in the Domestic Anritsu Group. The Corporate Ethics Promotion Committee and the Legal Department, which serve as its secretariat, coordinate with committees that promote legal compliance to advo- cate ethical and legal compliance to Anritsu Group compa- nies overseas in accordance with their national and regional laws, cultures, and customs. They provide necessary sup- port, and coordinate with compliance officers at each Anritsu Group company overseas to build a global compli- ance-promotion system. Internal audit departments per- form audits to determine whether the compliance promotion system is functioning appropriately, and provide advice and request improvements as necessary.
10. Environmental Risk (3) environmental risk
The Anritsu Group is subject to a variety of laws and regu- lations relating to the environment, including climate change, energy, the atmosphere, water, hazardous sub- stances, waste, and product recycling. The Group tackles the efforts to prevent climate change, create a recycling society, and prevent environmental pollution, in addition to ensuring the thorough environmental compliance of its business activities and products.
However, it is possible for tightened environmental regu- lations or past actions to trigger environmental liability, and for natural disasters and other events to cause environmen- tal pollution. Such events have the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and operating results due to additional costs required for legal compliance or environmental measures.
In order to meet the demands of its stakeholders, the Anritsu Group develops and offers products with an aware- ness of the environment throughout the entire product life cycle. The Anritsu Group is also committed to reducing its environmental pollution risk by reducing the CO2 emissions of its offices and factories through reducing the energy

usage from the perspective of preventing global warming and preserving biodiversity; reducing waste by promoting the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle); and setting self-man- agement standards that are stricter than laws and ordinanc- es related to preventing environmental pollution.
11. Product-Quality Risk (4) risk to the quality of products and services
The Anritsu Group has been ISO 9001 (an international standard for quality management systems) accredited since 1993. It operates integrated quality management, from product design and development to manufacture, service, and maintenance, at a global level. However, if an unfore- seen event that causes a major quality defect or product lia- bility is incurred, it has the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and oper- ating results, such as loss of society’s trust, lawsuits, social sanctions, and damage to the brand, as well as the cost of compensation and countermeasures.
The Anritsu Group has established committees to main- tain, improve, and assure product quality, and operate the quality management system appropriately, including the Quality Management System Committee and the Internal Quality Audit Committee. The Anritsu Group is also consid- ering the establishment of systems in the event of a prod- uct incident, a system to prevent product incidents, and initiatives to prevent recurrence.
12. Information Security (6) information security risk
The Anritsu Group has the social responsibility to appropri- ately protect the information of all of its stakeholders, including customers, trading partners, shareholders, and employees in its business activities. The Anritsu Group also recognizes that information assets are vital assets of the Anritsu Group and its stakeholders. If an information secu- rity incident were to occur with these information assets, due to a cyberattack, it has the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and oper- ating results due to effects such as loss of the trust of soci- ety, lawsuits, social sanctions, and damage to the brand.
The Anritsu Group works continuously to build its infor- mation security management system, carry out initiatives to maintain and improve thorough management and security,
and carry out information security education. As a company operating globally, the Company connects offices world- wide via networks and promoted sharing of information between them. A single vulnerability in information security impacts the overall security level. The Company is currently working to correct discrepancies in security levels between regions, alleviate regional disparities, and raise the bar as a whole.
13. Risk Related to Deferred Tax Assets (1) busi- ness risk
The Anritsu Group applies deferred tax accounting and rec- ognizes deferred tax assets. Calculation of deferred tax assets is based on projections that include estimates of future taxable profit, and the actual benefit may differ from the projection. If the tax benefits based on the estimate of future taxable profit are judged to be unavailable, these deferred tax assets are written down, which has the poten- tial to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s finan- cial condition and operating results.
14. Risk Related to Defined-Benefit Pension Plan (1) business risk
The amounts of retirement benefit payments and obliga- tions incurred in connection with employee defined-benefit pension plans of the parent company and certain of its sub- sidiaries are calculated based on assumptions, including dis- count rates, made for actuarial calculations. If the discount rates and other assumptions, which were made for the actuarial calculations of the expected amount of obligations under these defined-benefit pension plans undergo change, this has the potential to exert a material impact on the Anritsu Group’s financial condition and operating results.

Description
A project that was established to set third-generation (3G) mobile communications technology standards and LTE, LTE-Advanced (4G), and is now developing international standards for 5G.
Sixth-generation mobile communications technology. The name given to next-generation mobile communications technology which is being researched in various countries with the aim of launching services around 2030.
Mobile communications technology that will follow 5G. Essentially the same meaning as 6G.
An interface specification used to realize communication between Base-Band Units (BBU) and Remote Radio Heads (RRH) in systems where these are separated.
The world’s most-widespread Local Area Network (LAN) standard.
Fourth-generation (4G) mobile communications standards approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). LTE is a high-speed mobile communications system that enables data communication at 5 to 10 times the speed of 3G. LTE-Advanced is a standard that has realized speeds faster than LTE through the use of new technology such as carrier aggregation. International standards are set by 3GPP.
A wireless communications technology that enables faster communications speeds by using multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to transmit and receive data on the same frequency axis. One of the key technologies for LTE Advanced
A way to manage network communications functions as software on a virtual server OS.
A name given to systems that support networks operated by telecommunications business operators and service providers that offer mobile phone and other communications services.
An optical communications standard which enables WDM that was previously limited to one transmitter and one receiver to be used through a network. In addition to conventional telephone signals, it also enables signals such as IP and Ethernet to be processed in a unified manner.
International standards for signal multiplexing methods used in digital transmissions systems. These technologies enable low-speed signals, such as voice communications, to be multiplexed into and transmitted through prede- termined high-speed signals.
The name used for bands of 6GHz or less when referring to frequency ranges used in 5G systems. These are low band compared to millimeter wave bands. In 5G standards, bands of 6GHz or less have been defined as FR1, while millimeter wave bands have been defined as FR2.
A type of base station for mobile communications that have lower output power and are used to cover smaller areas. They are receiving attention for their potential application in 5G systems, which use high-frequency ranges and therefore require base stations to be established in high concentrations.
     5G New RAT (5G New Radio Access Technology)
  A new wireless communications technology for use with 5G. It can handle ultra-high speed communications in excess of 10Gbps.
   AOC (Active Optical Cable)
  A cable that combines optical fibers with an electrical signal connector that has an embedded optical-electric converter.
  Connectivity
  A general term signifying connections between and among mobile devices and other equipment and devices. This term is used to distinguish Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Near Field Communication (NFC), and other communication modes from cellular communications. In recent years, the use of connectivity has been expanded to include any connect- able device, including automobiles, digital cameras, home appliances, game devices, and healthcare devices.
  C-RAN (Centralized Radio Access Network)
  A radio access network architecture. Each wireless base station is equipped with only Radio Transceiver Devices. Radio Control Units are clustered upstream within the network to form a “Housing station” where signals are processed.
   IoT (Internet of Things)
  IoT not only allows computers and other communications devices to interact but also gives communications functions to manufacturing equipment in factories, appliances, and virtually anything else in the world around us. This enables these “things” to communicate when connected to the Internet and carry out tasks such as auto- mated control and remote measurement.
  Massive MIMO
  A technology that realizes advanced beamforming and spatial multiplexing by incorporating as many as 128 antennas, which is a huge increase compared to previous technologies, and dedicating an individual radio signal path to each antenna. This enables the comfortable use of mobile communications in crowded areas, such as stations and downtown districts, which previously tended to experience lags in communication speeds.
  NB-IoT (Narrow Band-IoT)
  An IoT communications system that uses mobile phone networks and has been standardized as an LTE standard by 3GPP.
  NSA-NR/SA-NR (Non- Standalone New Radio/ Standalone New Radio)
  5G international standard specifications developed by 3GPP.
NS-NR: An operating format that uses an existing LTE system to control data being sent through a 5G system. SA-NR: An operating format that controls every aspect of data communications through a 5G system on a stand-alone basis.
  OTA (Over The Air)
  Methods for testing wireless systems without using cables, used when testing mobile terminals.
  PCI-E (Peripheral Compo- nent Interconnect Express)
  An interface specification for PC expansion slots. It uses serial I/O interface standards set by Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG) in 2002. It is also referred to as PCIe and PCI Express.
  SDN (Software Defined Network)
  SDN is the name for technologies that enable structure, configuration, and settings of computer network to be altered in a flexible and dynamic manner by centrally controlling the communications devices that comprise the network through an individual piece of software.
  WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)
  An optical communications technology for transmitting large-capacity signals.
  Beamforming
  A technique that combines and concentrates radio signals and beams them in a specified direction. This technique improves spatial multiplexing performance by avoiding mutual interference between simultaneous communica- tions using the same frequency bands.

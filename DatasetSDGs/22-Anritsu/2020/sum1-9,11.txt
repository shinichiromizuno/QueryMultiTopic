Solving Social Issues Through Business
Description of Social Issues
Communication over Internet services such as social net- works, photo sharing, and video distribution, have become indispensable tools for “connecting” people with society. The communication network that realizes such “connec- tions” has evolved day by day, and now entering the 5G era that enables high-speed, large-capacity, ultra-low latency, and multiple simultaneous connections. 5G is expected to become a communications infrastructure that solves various social issues such as information disparity, traffic accident pre- vention, and labor shortages and realizes the sustainabile soci-
ety by being employed in industrial fields such as medical care, agriculture, automobiles, and disaster prevention in addi- tion to further sophisticate smartphones and tablet devices.
Anritsu Initiatives
The Test and Measurement Business provides added value by manufacturing original products at a high level, which corresponds to Goal 9 of the SDGs (Industry, innovation and infrastructure). We will also grow our contribution to Goal 11 (Sustainable cities and communities) by expanding our business in 5G including utilization by IoT. Furthermore, we will play our part in the Anritsu Group’s efforts to “resolve social issues as represented by the SDGs”, by realizing part- nerships with customers, developing environmentally friend- ly products, and strengthening overseas operations.
Societies with highly advanced information and commu- nications have potentials to solve a wide range of social issues including, for example, saving energy. Our measure- ment technologies will fulfill a role in making life more con- venient and ensuring comfort by raising the quality of communications networks. We will contribute to the cre- ation of sustainable society by making the maximum utili- zation of 5G and other technologies we own.

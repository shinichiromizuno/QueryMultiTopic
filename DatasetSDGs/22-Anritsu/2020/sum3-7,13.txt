Targeting About 30% Private Generation of Renewable Energy through Anritsu Climate Change Action PGRE 30
Anritsu Corporation has formulated “Anritsu Climate Change Action PGRE 30 (hereinafter “PGRE 30”*1)” as a new initiative for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. PGRE 30 will directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the use of renewable energy. Private generation of renew- able energy ratio accounted for 0.8% of the Anritsu Group’s electricity consumption*2 in FY2018 and we will raise this to about 30% by around 2030.
In FY2019, due to the addition of 57kW of solar panels in the Atsugi premises in January 2020 the ratio of private power generation reached 0.9%. In September 2020, 1,100 kW of solar panels will be installed in the United States and as a result, in FY2020 the private power genera- tion ratio is expected to be 4.3%.
PGRE 30 is Anritsu’s ambitious attempt to exceed Ja- pan’s 2030 renewable energy target of 22% to 24% (7% of which is from solar generation).
Target 7.2 in Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promotes increasing substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. PGRE 30 is Anritsu’s own unique contribution to directly expand- ing the use of renewable energy by introducing the solar
U.S. We believe this initiative will help to achieve the goals and targets in the SDGs.
Background to the Approach
As a countermeasure to the problems of climate change and man-made global warming, the Paris Agreement (COP21) was formulated in 2015 with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that the rise in average temperatures does not exceed 2°C compared to pre-indus- trial levels. This approach was set as a key issue within the SDGs adopted by the UN that same year.
Anritsu submitted its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the Science-Based Target (SBT) initiative*3 and it was approved in December 2019 as a plan matching pro- posed reduction scenarios based on IPCC*4 climate science.
The Anritsu Group’s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets that received SBT approval are as follows.
• Scope 1 & 2: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30%
compared to FY2015 levels by FY2030
• Scope 3: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions connected to
the use of products and services purchased and products sold by 30% compared to FY2018 levels by FY2030
Although the purchase of renewable energy credits/cer- tificates (RECs) was also considered for implementing this plan, we formulated PGRE 30 with a focus on generating renewable energy in-house as part of our initiatives for realizing the SDGs.
*1 PGRE 30: “PGRE” refers to Private Generation of Renewable Energy and “30” refers to the target of 30% Private Generation of Renewable Energy by around 2030.
*2 Electricity consumption of AT Techmac Co., Ltd. is excluded because it is not a whol- ly-owned subsidiary.
*3 SBT initiative
A joint initiative encouraging companies to set reduction targets that are in line with scientific knowledge to ensure that the rise in average temperatures does not exceed 2°C, or if possible 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels.

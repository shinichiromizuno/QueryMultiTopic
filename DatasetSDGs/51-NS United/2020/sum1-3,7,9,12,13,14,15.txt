Reducing Environmental Impact
Vessels Continue Taking Action for Environmental Conservation
The MARPOL Convention (The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as Modified by the 1978 and 1997 Protocol) was initially developed to prevent oil spills and oil pollution of the sea caused by tanker accidents. It was then expanded to cover a wide variety of pollutants, such as chemical cargoes, urine and other water pollutants produced on vessels, as well as the waste produced on board and air pollutants, and it adopts emissions regulations.
In addition to the MARPOL Convention, there are numerous other conventions and restrictions, such as those aimed at preventing damage
to ecosystems caused by the exchange of ballast water, prohibiting the use of ship paints that contain toxic substances, and (though not yet effective) a convention that specifies hazardous substances on board of scrapped vessels. Operating and owning vessels run the risk of causing environmental harm. There are regulations that restrict or prohibit the release of harmful substances, and regular inspections are conducted to confirm compliance with these regulations.
The Group must strictly implement measures to reduce any environmental impact.

The Future of GHG Emissions Regulations:
The Paris Agreement and the IMO’s Strategy to Reduce GHG Emissions
The 21st Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in Paris in 2015. The participating nations agreed to keep the average global temperature increase enough less than 2°C compared with pre-Industrial Revolution levels, and to work to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, with the goal of mitigating climate change.
Achieving these targets requires GHG emissions to be held in balance with the level of being absorbed by ecosystems. Nations have
Establishing New Environmental Targets
The IMO’s target is to improve fuel efficiency by 40% by 2030 while reducing CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050, both compared with annual CO2 emissions level in 2008. The ultimate goal is the complete elimination of CO2 emissions.
begun initiatives aimed at achieving these targets. This means that every person needs to address climate change.
However, since the GHG emissions from international marine shipping do not fit in well with the country-specific measures of the UNFCCC, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has considered this issue and set goals for reducing GHG emissions in 2018.
The Company responded to these goals by adding new environmental targets to the medium-term business plan.
The Company will improve annual fuel efficiency, (CO2 emissions per transported unit) by 20% by 2030, and by 60% by 2050, using 2019 as the base year.
Improve fuel efficiency by 20% (40% improvement compared with 2008)

        The Company’s CO2 reduction targets are specified as equivalent to the target reduction rates of the IMO’s GHG reduction strategy. (The Company has improved fuel efficiency by approximately 25%, as of 2019, compared with the 2008 level.)
Over the past 10 years, the Company has reduced CO2 emissions in several ways, including deploying larger vessels, navigating at reduced speeds, and more effective allocations to achieve both economic efficiency and reduced GHG emissions. Our new goals are based on fuel efficiency evaluation standards, in order to visualize the balance between maintaining and growing business activities while reducing

As one initiative to promote GHG reductions going forward, last year the Company carried out a trial design, jointly with Imabari Shipbuilding, of a vessel powered by LNG fuel. We obtained Approval in Principal for the vessel from ClassNK, a classification society. The Company is also speeding up ship-to-land communications and installing operational support systems.

Over the next 10 years, the Company will introduce information and digitization technologies as well as make improvement to the initiatives we have carried out so far. We will also develop other initiatives to achieve environmental targets, introducing such new technologies as LNG-powered vessels.

Environmental Education
In-house Education
We created an Environmental Education Implementation Plan to provide education on the environment and carry this out during the training for new employees, including seamen, and at the meetings of each group. While the Environmental Management System that focuses on Environmental Policy is introduced during new employee training, the agenda of the Safety and Environmental Committee, and the status of internal and external environmental audits are shared at the meetings of each group.
Education for Crewmembers
For crewmembers of our managed vessels, we have developed and conducted onboard education and training programs as part of OJT (on-the-job training) in addition to classroom training on land. The curriculum covers environmental protection and is being implemented during pre-boarding seminars and in-house seminars by crew manning companies to reinforce awareness of safe, efficient vessel operation, and environmental preservation.
Some of this training is conducted online, connecting offshore and onshore participants including manning companies via the Internet and satellite. As part of the in-house seminars, we provide a curriculum related to MARPOL Convention compliance that includes
Emergency Response Drills
The NS United Kaiun Group regularly holds emergency response drills, assuming marine accidents.
We hold company-wide drills every year. Once every two years, we invite external parties (members of the shipping media, insurance companies, etc.) to participate in large-scale drills, including mock (simulated) press conferences. Every drill is based on the scenario of an accident involving an oil spill from a vessel, enabling participants to confirm the emergency procedures used to minimize marine pollution.
In November 2019, we conducted a company-wide emergency response drill based on the scenario of an accident where one of our operating bulk carriers loaded with coal collides with a coastal vessel, punctured the other ship’s hull, causing it to sink and spill oil, and one of the ship’s crewmembers went missing. Among those participating in the drill were the president, executives, and employees from the general affairs, finance and accounting, and concerned sales departments, in addition to the safety management and the ship management departments. We coordinated between the vessel and shore, and contacted the vessel management companies. The participants confirmed the response measures necessary during an emergency.
vessel waste management, operation of the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), and the structure and operation of scrubbers, together with the switchover of fuels, to comply with stricter NOx and SOx emissions regulations. Further, participants are provided with an overview of past accidents and countermeasures. The seminars raise awareness of cybersecurity programs. As well, they help crewmembers acquire new skills and improve existing ones.

NS United Naiko Kaiun Kaisha, Ltd. uses accident scenarios involving the response of the ship in the event of a fire and the tremendous social impact of running aground at a fishing plant to confirm our ability to respond effectively.
NS United Coastal Tanker Kaisha. Ltd. used the scenario of an accident where one of its operating vessels collides with other coastal vessel, causing an oil spill, the ship listing due to taking on water, and a crewmember being injured by the collision, and focused training on confirming the initial response based on those conditions.

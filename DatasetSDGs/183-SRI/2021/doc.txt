  Our Philosophy—A Cornerstone for Sumitomo Rubber
Group Operations
For us to achieve further business growth in a time of uncertainty and volatility like the current moment, we must refresh our understanding of our reason for being and clearly define it in a way that establishes unwavering guide- lines for Group employees and resonates with all of our stakeholders.
Based on this recognition, we have established Our Philosophy, a new corporate philosophy structure.
Our revamped corporate philosophy structure upholds the fundamental ideas of “fulfilling our responsibilities to society as a good corporate citizen,” “pursuing greater happiness for all Group employees,” and “living up to the expectations of our customers.” These ideas are firmly grounded in the Sumitomo Business Spirit, which has long been passed down by Sumitomo Group entities.
The Origins of the Sumitomo Business Spirit
Masatomo Sumitomo, the founder of the Sumitomo Group, left behind writings known as “Monjuin Shiigaki” (“The Founder’s Precepts”), which provide a set of principles and guidelines for merchants to abide by.
His teachings have supported the business operations of the Sumitomo Group throughout its 400-year history, passed down from generation to generation in the form of the “Sumitomo Business Spirit,” whose essence was more recently condensed into the mod- ern “Business Principles” of the Sumitomo Group.
Containing such principles as “The business activities of Sumitomo must benefit not only Sumitomo, but must also be of benefit to the nation and to society as a whole,” the Sumitomo Business Spirit reflects Sumitomo’s strong sense of duty to society. To this day, the Sumitomo Business Spirit still forms the basis for the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s own Corporate Mission.

The Sumitomo Rubber Group’s Approach to Value Creation
 TOP COMMITMENT
  Further Enhancing Our Economic Value & Our Value to Society
Satoru Yamamoto
President & Representative Director, President and CEO
Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd.
  Firstly, my heart goes out to all of those who have lost their lives to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). I would like to take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to all of the families who are now grieving as a result of COVID-19 and to pray for the swift recovery of each and every person currently afflicted with this terrible disease. At the same time, I would also like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude and admiration to all of those who continue working tirelessly to provide medical care and prevent the further spread of infections on the front lines of medicine all over the world, all while facing ongoing concerns about the possibility of new outbreaks and lingering uncertainty about what the future holds in store.
In February 2020, the Sumitomo Rubber Group unveiled our new Midterm Plan, which aims to achieve sales revenues of ¥1 trillion and business profit of ¥100 billion by the year 2025. However, not long after we made this announcement, COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world. In light of the pandemic, we made the health and safety of our employees and their families our top priority. Once assured that their health and safety were sufficiently secure, we next turned our attention to the matter of how best to keep our business up and running under the circumstances, focusing our efforts on various measures intended to keep the impact of the pandemic on our business performance to a minimum.
In February, we established a Crisis Management HQ in order to share information throughout our global group in a timely manner while also sending a strong message to our employees around the world, reassuring them that we would surely overcome these times of hardship together.
The first half of last year was marked by a drastic deterioration in overall market conditions, which meant that, in addition to implementing extensive measures to protect our employees from infection, we were left with no choice but to take such emergency operational measures as halting production at several of our factories. At the same time, however, we were proceeding with steady preparations in anticipation of a strong market recovery once the situation improved. And so, as market condi- tions began to improve from the second half of the year (first in China and North America), our group was able to respond swiftly to the conse- quent uptick in demand. As a result, we not only succeeded in increasing our sales, but even achieved an increase in profits for the second half of the 2020 compared to second half of 2019.
Even in the midst of the pandemic, we nevertheless continued to push ahead with efforts to tackle the challenges defined in our Midterm Plan while adding to and revising our action plans as necessary according to the changing situation. For example, by accelerating various efforts with the aim of “Developing & Promoting Sales of Advanced Products,” we
have been able to maintain steady sales of SUV tires in spite of the recent market downturn. This has given us a renewed appreciation for the market strength of products backed by advanced technology. Meanwhile, working to cope with the “New Normal” of life with COVID-19 has brought to light a whole new set of challenges and so we have responded to these new challenges through Group-wide efforts to fully utilize digital technology in order to bring about changes in terms of how we interact with customers and, in tandem with the rise of telework, even in terms of how we work.
Thanks to tireless hard work on the part of employees throughout the Sumitomo Rubber Group, we not only were able to respond flexibly to the pandemic while minimizing its negative impact on our business perfor- mance, but also made sure and steady progress in tackling the challeng- es embodied in the Three Key Value Drivers set forth in our Midterm Plan. In light of this, we have decided not to change our performance targets for 2025. Rather, we will continue working toward the achieve- ment of our Midterm Plan goals while adding to and revising our action plans as necessary.
In 2020, the COVID-19 Pandemic brought massive changes to the lives and daily routines of people around the world. Meanwhile, the automotive industry was and is still in the midst of a “once in a century” transforma- tion, while advances in digital technology have led to significant changes in consumer behavior across all industries. In other words, even before the pandemic, the business environment was already changing in various ways and the pace of this change is only increasing. I believe that, if we are to respond flexibly to these changes and achieve the goals of our Midterm Plan, it will be essential that we harness the full capabilities of our entire workforce. Since becoming the president of Sumitomo Rubber Industries, I have actively taken advantage of numerous opportunities to visit our group companies throughout the world and to talk with as many employees as possible about the work being done on the front lines of our business as well as about what they are thinking. My interactions with our colleagues in various positions left me with a strong desire to turn the Sumitomo Rubber Group into a corporate group that can bring together the combined strength of all of our employees while amplifying and focusing this strength on a common vector in order to propel our business forward.
This desire would become the impetus behind the formation of our “Be the Change Project” (BTC Project), an initiative that we launched last year with the aim of “Reinforcing the Foundations of Our Business.” Specifically, this project aims to “Reinforce Our Foundation for Profitability” and “Improve Our Organizational Framework” by overcoming organizational barriers and promoting the free and open exchange of ideas and opinions in order to strengthen vertical and horizontal connec- tions among our employees so that these connections may serve as the basis for tackling various challenges together.
I fully believe that these activities will enable us to strengthen our cor- porate culture and establish a sturdy profit structure, one that is compet- itive, adaptive to change and resilient in the face of adversity, thereby endowing us with a strong corporate framework that will remain unshaken by whatever environmental changes we may face in the future. It is my hope that this project will prove effective not only in terms of changing
how our employees carry out their day-to-day work, but also on the level of changing the mindset of our employees. Through this process, we will also be creating a corporate culture in which all members of our diverse workforce can truly spread their wings and fly. Toward this end, corporate executives must first change themselves and then lead by example. We need to think less in terms of optimizing our own departments and more in terms of customer perspectives as well as the big picture of our entire group (which also means breaking down organizational barriers). We need to work together as a team with a strong emphasis on cooperation between departments. We need to share information openly and engage in active debate while respecting the diversity of ideas and people. We need to have the courage to take that first step forward when faced with a challenge. We need to boldly tackle the challenges of major and com- plex issues. These are the kinds of messages that we are now sending to our employees on a daily basis in the interests of spurring change.
As part of these initiatives, we are also actively promoting Work Style Reform. Based on the belief that stronger vertical and horizontal connec- tions give rise to greater results, we have been forging ahead with reforms on two fronts: promoting Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) and promot- ing Digital Transformation (DX). With more than 39,000 employees worldwide, the Sumitomo Rubber Group will be working harder than ever to create a corporate culture in which diverse employees can respect one another, work freely and openly and truly shine while doing worthwhile work. Meanwhile, advances in DX will free up more time for our workers, giving them the leeway needed to take on the challenges of performing work that produces even more added value. In this way, I hope to see each of our employees find genuine job satisfaction by harnessing his/ her own strengths and talents to their fullest. At the same time, commu- nication is absolutely essential to promoting these new kinds of work styles. I firmly believe that our employees can accomplish great things by forging strong vertical and horizontal connections among themselves. The activities of the BTC Project form the cornerstone of our full-fledged efforts to bring about real Work Style Reform.
Since kicking off in earnest in April 2020, the BTC Project has pushed forward with various activities intended not only to change the mindset and the behavior of each and every employee for the better, but also to create new value, reduce costs, generate cash flow and so forth. Already, these activities have produced more than 4,000 new ideas, which are collectively worth some ¥30 billion in added cash flow and ¥10 billion in added profit. Through these activities, the capabilities of each and every employee and by extension the combined capabilities of our entire orga- nization, are already steadily improving, thus leaving our organization better able to produce results. While this cross-organizational project started out as a series of top-down directives from the Project Headquarters, it has now expanded to spawn a growing number of off- shoot projects intended to enhance our overall value and these are now primarily driven by ideas percolating upward from departments through- out our group. This is a sure sign that our employees, not content to sit around and wait for somebody else to bring about change, are now beginning to act with the courage to take that first step forward and bring about change on their own.
Moving forward, I would like for us to continue to expand this project and forge ahead with efforts to reinforce the foundations of our global business so that we can make the Sumitomo Rubber Group into an even more appealing corporate group, all the while maintaining a reasonable

sense of anxiety about the crises that we currently face as well as hope for a brighter future, with both in equal measure.
Progress on Our Midterm Plan
The Midterm Plan that we announced in February of last year aims to enhance our group’s economic value as well as our value to society by maximizing results from the global business framework that we built up in the years leading up to 2020, by advancing our vision for bringing new value to tires—as embodied in our “SMART TYRE CONCEPT”—to the next level and by building a strong corporate structure that can withstand any and all changes in the business environment through activities to “Reinforce the Foundations of Our Business.” All of these efforts will be driven by Three Key Value Drivers: “Developing & Promoting Sales of Advanced Products,” “Creating New Value” and “Promoting ESG Management.”
Maximizing Results from Our Global Business Framework
Thanks to various investments that we have made to date, the Sumitomo Rubber Group now possesses a network of production factories and sales companies situated near major demand centers throughout the world (including, of course, Japan). Among all of the major tire manufacturers in the world, only a small handful of our competitors have thus far been able to build a comparable global network for both manufacturing and sales. What this means is that our customers now have all the more rea- son to have very high expectations of us. While our factories in North America and South Africa still have some issues to work out, they are nevertheless pushing ahead with sure and steady improvements. We will be sure to get both of these key production bases on the right track so that we can finalize a supply network that is not only truly global, but that is also capable of providing a uniform level of quality and service anywhere in the world. In particular, supplying our tires to global automobile manu- facturers worldwide will drive us to further enhance our technical capa- bilities while simultaneously serving to enhance our position as a trusted manufacturer in the consumer market for replacement tires. Moving for- ward, we hope to fully harness the potential of our global framework in order to better respond to the needs of our customers around the world.
Advancing SMART TYRE CONCEPT to the Next Level
Our SMART TYRE CONCEPT embodies our vision for bringing new value to tires and the Sumitomo Rubber Group is now actively engaged in efforts to advance this concept to the next level.
When it comes to “Tires Providing Solutions for Safety & Peace of Mind,” we are actively engaged in the development of new systems that will take fuller advantage of our existing “Deflation Warning System” (which is already available on the market) and SENSING CORE Technology (which transforms tires into sensors to detect road conditions) by sharing various types of information gleaned from tires through the cloud so that this information can be put to use for the benefit of all. The Sumitomo Rubber Group will continue working to advance our SMART TYRE CONCEPT technology, taking it to the next level so that we can create the tires and services of the future, by which we mean tires and services that provide longer lasting safety and even actively avoid hazards.
When it comes to “Tires Incorporating Life Cycle Assessment,” we will continue working to develop tires that have less environmental impact throughout their entire life cycles, from production and sales through usage and ultimate disposal. Toward this end, we have already devel- oped and released tires that incorporate biomass materials and are now working to develop tires that feature even higher levels of biomass con- tent as part of our ongoing efforts to contribute to the creation of a sus- tainable society.
Three Key Value Drivers
Our Midterm Plan defines Three Key Value Drivers for propelling our ongoing efforts to enhance both our group’s economic value and our value to society: “Developing & Promoting Sales of Advanced Products,” “Creating New Value” and “Promoting ESG Management.”
When it comes to “Developing & Promoting Sales of Advanced Products,” our “ENASAVE NEXT III” has received widespread acclaim not only for incorporating our proprietary Performance Sustaining Technology, but also as the world’s first tire to adopt Cellulose Nanofiber, an advanced biomass material being promoted by the Japanese government as a pri- ority industry. At the same time, thanks to our robust “Trilateral R&D Network” (with bases in Japan, the United States and Europe), we have been working together with automobile manufacturers in each region to advance the development of tires for electric vehicles (EVs) in order to meet rising demand for EVs in major markets throughout the world. The Sumitomo Rubber Group will continue to take full advantage of our pro- prietary materials and design technologies to develop tires that can bring out the full performance potential of EVs.
When it comes to “Creating New Value,” we will offer a growing lineup of solutions services to ensure customer safety and peace of mind while also improving operational efficiency for reduced costs. This includes Tire Pressure Management Services that take full advantage of our propri- etary SENSING CORE Technology, which transforms tires themselves into sensors, thus allowing for the detection of information on road conditions (such as slipperiness), tire conditions (tire load, etc.) and so forth without requiring the installation of sensors or other additional hardware. As this technology advances further, it will become possible for vehicles to detect and even avoid upcoming hazards related to tire or road conditions by taking advantage of comprehensive data gleaned from tires and then compiled and shared at the city or even society level through the cloud.
Through ongoing cooperation with external partners, the Sumitomo Rubber Group will continue working to provide total solutions to respond to the needs arising from CASE and MaaS, thereby creating new value that goes beyond tires.
In order for the Sumitomo Rubber Group to achieve further growth while adeptly responding to a business environment that is increasingly uncer- tain and fraught with drastic change, we felt that the time had come for us to redefine the purpose of our existence in a way that would provide steadfast guiding principles for all of our employees and fully resonate with all of our stakeholders.
Thus, in December 2020, we promulgated “Our Philosophy,” a new corporate philosophy framework that clearly defines the Purpose of the Sumitomo Rubber Group not merely in terms of the simple pursuit of profit, but with a particular emphasis on carrying out sustainable busi- ness activities in harmony with society and with the environment. It is our hope that Our Philosophy will align all of us on the same vector by serving as the basis behind our decisions and the impetus behind our actions, thereby creating a powerful driving force to propel our group ever faster toward the accomplishment of our strategic goals.
From the beginning, the “Sumitomo Business Spirit” has served as the basis for decisions within the Sumitomo Group throughout its nearly 400 years of history. The Sumitomo Rubber Group has been no exception, turning to it regularly as we engaged in various business activities over the years and even weaving it into our own corporate philosophy, which was first promulgated in 1963. Since then, although we have revised the contents of our corporate philosophy in keeping with changing times and changes to our business, we have nevertheless continuously upheld the basic ideals enshrined in the Sumitomo Business Spirit, such as “fulfilling our responsibilities to society as a good corporate citizen,” “pursuing greater happiness for all of our employees” and “living up to the expec- tations of our customers.” While still maintaining these basic ideals, we have now overhauled our corporate philosophy framework in the form of “Our Philosophy.” At the pinnacle of Our Philosophy is our Purpose, which states the very reason for our existence: “Through innovation we will create a future of joy and well-being for all.”
In addition, we have also devised a new corporate slogan, a simple statement reflecting the worldview espoused by Our Philosophy: “Rubber and Beyond, Driving Our Future.” The phrase “Rubber and Beyond” has two meanings: it refers to both “cutting-edge rubber technology” and “expanding the possibilities of rubber to develop new technologies and provide new value.” Meanwhile, the phrase “Driving Our Future” reflects our desire to bring joy to the hearts of all who come into contact with our products and services, driven by the boundless flexibility and endless possibilities of rubber materials. I believe that what the world now needs from the Sumitomo Rubber Group is for each and every one of us to continue tackling the challenges of creating and providing greater “joy and well-being” to uplift people, society, the environment and the future. We hope that our newly defined Purpose will serve as the basis for all of our decisions and as the impetus for all of our actions in both our work and our management so that we may contribute to the development and
continuing prosperity of a more sustainable society as envisioned by the international community.
With the aim of fully living up to the ideals enshrined in Our Philosophy, the Sumitomo Rubber Group is already actively tackling various challenges in order to develop products with less environmental impact and to create the tires and services of the future for greater safety and peace of mind.
In keeping with the Sumitomo Business Spirit, which has been passed down through generations over nearly 400 years of Sumitomo history, the Sumitomo Rubber Group actively promotes and engages in various social contribution activities, including the provision of free-of-charge tire safety inspections, collecting employee donations through our “Sumitomo Rubber CSR Fund” and the “Team ENASAVE Mirai Project,” which is a joint pro- gram undertaken in cooperation with the National Federation of UNESCO Associations in Japan with the aim of promoting activities to preserve both the environment and traditional culture. One of the highlights of our social contribution efforts is our ongoing “GENKI Activities,” employee volunteer activities that first started out as “activities to invigorate every- one” (“genki” means “lively” in Japanese) and that have now continued for over thirty years. As part of these activities, employees at eleven of our facilities throughout Japan have created “GENKI Forests” by collect- ing acorns, cultivating them into saplings and then planting them to combat deforestation. GENKI Activities also include activities to protect endangered species and other biodiversity conservation efforts, as well as various other volunteer activities that altogether involve some 16,000 employees and their family members each year. Moving forward, the Sumitomo Rubber Group will continue to actively promote and engage in activities that aim to invigorate local communities and the earth.
By working to create new value in terms of both our economic value and our value to society, we at the Sumitomo Rubber Group continually strive to contribute to the creation of more sustainable societies in which peo- ple can live and work safely and with peace of mind. In the future, we will continue working to produce even greater economic and social throughout all of our business activities as only the Sumitomo Rubber Group can.

    Progress Report on Our Midterm Plan
Shortly after we unveiled our Midterm Plan in February 2020, our business was impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Nevertheless, we have continued to run our business surely and steadily in accordance with the framework set forth in our Midterm Plan while adding to and revising our various action plans as necessary according to changes in market conditions and work styles.
Moving forward, we will continue working to further enhance both our economic value and our value to society with an emphasis on improving the quality of our earnings and ensuring the sustainability of our business, with all of these efforts driven by our Three Key Value Drivers.
  Anticipating Recovery in the Tire Industry
Due to the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, global demand for tires plummeted in 2020, with annual gross demand falling to approximately 1.6 billion tires, which is just 86% of the previous year’s demand level. Further, global demand is not expected to recover to pre-pandemic (i.e. 2019) levels until around 2022 (Graph 1).
Graph 2 illustrates global tire demand in 2020 and 2021 (projected), as well as our group’s sales plan for that same period, compared to 2019 figures, which are used as a baseline (set at 100). Our group’s

sales in 2020 (at 88) fared somewhat better than overall global demand that year (at 86). In 2021, we are planning for our sales to recover to 97, which once again exceeds the anticipated recovery in global demand (to 95) and represents an 11% increase over 2020.
We are also planning to improve sales mix in addition to volume. In particular, we are planning to increase sales of Advanced Tires (a market segment in which we excel) to 113 in 2021 (a 22% increase over 2020).
In order to ensure the accomplishment of our Midterm Plan, in 2020, we launched the “Be the Change Project” to “Reinforce Our Foundation for Profitability” and “Improve Our Organizational Framework.” Since then, we have engaged in various cross- organizational activities that aim to generate cash flow and raise the bar in terms of cost competitiveness while working to bring to light major issues affecting multiple areas of our organization so that we can then move forward with improvements and so forth.
Involving many employees throughout our group, our efforts to enhance our cash flow generation capabilities have brought together both top management and frontline workers in actively working to design and carry out activities to promote and instill proper cash- flow management practices.
Meanwhile, project teams formed mainly of members from our Manufacturing Division and Procurement Division have been lead- ing efforts to enhance our cost improving capabilities by working to improve the overall efficiency of our procurement of raw materials and equipment.
To date, these activities have already generated over 4,000 ideas for improvement measures, which are collectively worth some ¥30 billion in added cash flow and ¥10 billion in added profit. Moving forward, we will steadily put these ideas into action one after another so that we can be sure to reap these benefits.
When it comes to “Improving Our Organizational Framework,” we have been pushing forward with Group-wide activities to shed light on organizational issues (such as the organizational barriers that
have arisen as a natural consequence of our rapid growth and expansion) so that we can then move forward with improvements. In order to transition toward work styles that encourage the proac- tive tackling of challenges, we have expanded our internal job post- ing system and established a new system that allows employees to experience working in different departments for a fixed period of time. In addition, we have also set about reforming our personnel system, beginning with a shift to a job-based personnel system for managers from April 2021 as the first step. At the same time, our entire group is actively pushing ahead with Work Style Reform as well as efforts to promote Diversity & Inclusion.

3 Pillars of Our Global Framework
Global Supply Network
One of the Key Challenges set forth in our Midterm Plan is “Maximizing Results from Our Global Business Framework,” and we are now tackling this challenge on three fronts: “Global Manufacturing & Sales Network,” “Trilateral R&D Network (Japan/ USA/Europe) and “Global Supply Network.”
With manufacturing and sales bases in major markets throughout the world, the Sumitomo Rubber Group has already established the necessary framework to directly supply products and services that meet the diverse needs of our customers throughout the world. At the same time, we have built a Trilateral R&D Network with bases in each major region so that we can develop products that better meet the localized needs of each market.
Building Stronger, Trust-Based Relationships with Automakers
Expanding OE Fitment to Take Advantage of a Ripple Effect for Replacement Tire Sales
Meanwhile, on the supply side, in addition to harnessing the full production capacity of our factories around the world in order to promote local production for local consumption, the Sumitomo Rubber Group has established a flexible supply system that allows us to supplement local capacity by shipping tires from our flagship factory in Thailand (one of the largest tire factories on earth and the centerpiece of our global supply network) directly to markets all over the world. Through the measures discussed above, we will leverage this enhanced responsiveness in order to reinforce the foundations of our business by building stronger, trust-based rela- tionships with automobile manufacturers with an eye toward expanding OE fitment so that we can then take advantage of a rip- ple effect to increase replacement tire sales.

The current state of our global manufacturing and sales network by region is as follows: First, in Japan and the rest of Asia, we have already established a robust network of cost-efficient manufactur- ing bases, where we are now in the process of updating equipment to increase production capacity for SUV tires in order to keep pace with evolving market needs. Moving forward, we will continue work- ing to maintain steady sales in Japan and China as the main driver of profits in the region.
Next, in Europe and Africa, our factory in Turkey (our main supply base for markets in Europe) has made steady progress in augment- ing production capacity and is now working to maximize the advan- tages of economies of scale with an eye toward simultaneously expanding our supply of tires to European automobile manufactur- ers and increasing replacement tire sales in the region. Meanwhile,
our factory in South Africa is pushing ahead with ongoing efforts to improve productivity while transitioning to the production of high value-added products.
Lastly, in the Americas, in addition to our steadily increasing overall sales in North America, our factory in the United States has also made great strides in improving productivity, thereby bringing our overall North American Business closer and closer to achieving profitability. Meanwhile, our factory in Brazil has increased produc- tion capacity to promote local production for local consumption while building up a robust local sales network, which has enabled our South American business to make significant improvements in terms of both pricing and sales mix. Thanks to these improvements, we are now well on our way to establishing a solid foundation for stable profitability in the region.

R&D Network to Respond to the Evolving Needs of Each Market
In order to more adeptly respond to the distinct needs of each mar- ket, we have established a Trilateral R&D Network that includes development bases in three major regions: Asia (which includes Japan and China), Europe and North America. This robust frame- work enables us to better respond to the increasingly stringent per- formance demands of automobile manufacturers worldwide while accelerating the development of advanced tires for electric vehicles in preparation for their rapid proliferation in the near future.
Our Tire Technical Center in Japan serves as our main develop- ment headquarters, where we engage in advanced materials research and advance the development of cutting-edge technolo- gies while developing high-performance tires and other strategic products for global markets as well as tires designed for local
markets in Asia (including Japan and China). In China, our develop- ment and sales teams are working hand-in-hand to expand our sup- ply business with Chinese automobile manufacturers in response to rising market share, focusing in particular on efforts to increase OE fitment on electric vehicles. In 2020, we also established the neces- sary infrastructure for performing live vehicle testing in China.
In both Europe and North America, our local technical teams are able to respond swiftly to the needs of automobile manufacturers by developing tires that are well-suited to local conditions in each market. In the future, we are planning to expand the scope of their responsibilities to cover development for Africa and South and Central America as well.

Bolstered by strong sales of our FALKEN brand tires, our overall sales in North America increased in 2020 even as market demand plummeted as a result of the pandemic. All signs cur- rently indicate that this sales momentum will likely continue through 2021 and beyond.
Thanks to steadily increasing sales volume and market share
Increasing Replacement Tire Sales Volume*
in the North American market over the past several years, in 2020, FALKEN became the fifth most popular brand of passen- ger car tires by market share in the region. In keeping with its expanded market share, FALKEN’s price position has also steadily improved, thereby making a solid contribution to the further expansion of our overall business in North America.
In light of strong sales in the North American market and the reassuring pace of improvement at our factory in the United States, we recently made the decision to invest in increasing production capacity at our USA Factory as well as at our major export bases in Japan and Thailand. With these investments, we will greatly enhance our ability to respond to market demand (and especially demand for SUV tires) in North America by expanding our overall supply capacity with a combination of locally produced and imported tires.
With an investment of ¥10.1 billion, we will introduce the lat- est labor-saving production equipment at our USA Factory, thereby increasing the factory’s annual supply capacity by 1.8 million tires (for passenger cars and light trucks).
Meanwhile, having determined that the provisional anti-dumping
tariff rate proposed for tires imported to the United States from Thailand (if ultimately imposed) would have only a minor impact on our business in the region, we have also decided to invest a combined total of ¥10.8 billion to increase production capacity at our factories in Japan and Thailand. Taken together, these investments in our factories in the United States, Japan and Thailand will increase our group’s supply capacity for the North American market to the tune of 3.8 million tires per year.
In addition to the abovementioned investment in increasing supply capacity for passenger car and light truck tires, we are also planning to invest in increasing production capacity for truck and bus tires at our factory in the United States, thus bringing our total planned investment in our USA Factory to ¥12.8 billion.

Developing & Promoting Sales of Advanced Products
Promoting ESG Management
  One of our leading Advanced Products, “ENASAVE NEXT III” has received numerous awards, including the prestigious Energy Conservation Grand Prize “Agency for Natural Resources and Energy Director-General’s Award.” In addition to enhanced overall tire performance, ENASAVE NEXT III also achieves both longer last- ing performance and improved fuel efficiency thanks to the adop- tion of a revolutionary new “Hydrogenated Polymer” material. Further, ENASAVE NEXT III is also the world’s first tire to incorpo- rate “Cellulose Nanofiber,” an advanced biomass material promoted by the Japanese government as a priority industry initiative. Thanks to these advances, ENASAVE NEXT III has received widespread acclaim as a product that deftly apprehends and responds to evolving market needs.
At the same time, we have also been accelerating the development of tires designed for electric vehicles. In 2020, we developed tires that not only reduce rolling resistance in order to achieve improved fuel efficiency, but also provide superior grip and wear resistance
performance thanks to our proprietary compounding technology. These tires were recently adopted by Toyota Motor Corporation as factory standard tires for their MIRAI line of fuel cell vehicles.
The Sumitomo Rubber Group is now engaged in initiatives that aim to achieve carbon neutrality (i.e. reduce net CO2 emissions by 100%) at all of our factories by the year 2050.
Our Scope 1 initiatives have involved proactive energy conserva- tion efforts, including the introduction of cogeneration systems and the active utilization of IT to reduce various types of energy loss. Moving forward, we are planning not only to augment these efforts, but also to transition away from the use of fossil fuels entirely by replacing the fossil fuels that we currently use with hydrogen, bio- mass fuel and other renewable energy sources that are being hailed as the future of energy. For example, we are already in the process of exploring the possibility of using hydrogen energy to power our major tire factories in Japan.
Our Scope 2 initiatives involve the installation of additional solar panels as well as plans for expanded procurement of Green Energy. Our main Scope 3 initiatives will involve working to develop prod- ucts that include more biomass materials throughout all of our lines of business. In 2013, the Sumitomo Rubber Group released our groundbreaking “ENASAVE 100,” the world’s first 100% fossil resource-free tires made from all-natural materials. Taking advantage of the technologies that we refined in the development of “ENASAVE 100, we have since released multiple products that incorporate var- ious advanced biomass materials, such as “Liquid Farnesene Rubber” and “Cellulose Nanofiber.” Moving forward, we will continue working toward achieving carbon neutrality for the future through the development of products that feature ever greater proportions

   Our proprietary SENSING CORE Technology is a software-based technology that analyzes wheel speed signals (which are transmitted as a tire rotates) in order to detect various conditions pertaining to tire status, such as a decrease in tire pressure. What sets SENSING CORE apart is the fact that it uses tires themselves as sensors, meaning that it requires no additional sensors or other hardware and is completely maintenance-free. Our SENSING CORE tire pressure sensing technology has already been adopted in over forty million vehicles to date.
We have also recently made further advancements in our SENSING CORE Technology, establishing a new technology that can detect tire wear status. With this advancement, SENSING CORE is now able to detect tire wear in addition to tire pressure, tire load and road conditions. With these and other proprietary technologies, we aim to contribute to the advancement of the Mobility Society of the Future by responding to the new needs that will arise from the rapid rise of CASE and MaaS.

 A Message from the Chief Financial Officer
  Review of Financial Results
Due to the global fallout from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the business environment surrounding our group has been extremely severe, with market conditions deteriorating significantly in the first six months—and particularly in the sec- ond quarter—of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020). Although market conditions began to recover in the sec- ond half, albeit in varying degree from region to region, our overall performance remained sluggish throughout the fiscal year.

          Our Financial Strategy for Achieving Our Midterm Plan Objectives
Q
Currently, our principal aim with respect to investment is to boost pro- duction capacity for Advanced Tires in line with our efforts to expand sales in markets throughout the world. In fiscal 2020, our capital expen- ditures totaled ¥41.9 billion, which represents a decrease of ¥16.2 billion year-on-year and reflects a more restrained investment policy imple- mented in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. By con- trast, we plan to invest a total of ¥59.0 billion in fiscal 2021. Reversing our previous policy of reining in investment in our overseas factories, we will now undertake various capital expenditures with the aim of increas- ing our group’s overall production capacity. At the same time, we will also be working to update existing manufacturing lines at our domestic factories to allow for increased production of Advanced Products. Meanwhile, the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s factory management tech- niques are now being embraced by those working at our USA Factory just as strong sales of our FALKEN brand tires are propelling the growth of our business in North America. Thus, our ongoing efforts to improve productivity and quality since acquiring this factory are now beginning to yield sure and steady results. Thanks to these factors, we felt confident enough to greenlight major capital expenditures to increase the factory’s production capacity in a manner that will put us ahead of the competi- tion when it comes to capitalizing on recovering demand coinciding with the resumption of economic activities in the United States. This invest- ment is expected to total US $122 million (approximately ¥12.8 billion).
Hiroki Ishida
Director and Senior Executive Officer
Going forward, over the medium term, we will continuously strive to make improvements in terms of cost factors while also working to dilute fixed costs attributable to capital expenditures that we have undertaken with the aim of increasing production capacity.
We are currently striving to ascertain the specific measures needed to yield positive cash-generating effects via improvements in working capital and the efficiency of capital expenditures. Our fiscal 2020 cash flow figures included a ¥32.0 billion increase in cash flows from operat- ing activities compared with the previous fiscal year, thanks mainly to a decrease in inventory levels. Cash flows from investing activities similarly improved, with a ¥17.8 billion increase in cash inflows due to such fac- tors as a decrease in overall capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow grew from positive ¥28.0 billion in fiscal 2019 to positive ¥77.9 billion in fiscal 2020.
Striving to push ahead with these and other cash-generation activities, we will work to introduce various new measures to generate cash while also striving to lock in solid results from our existing cash-generating measures. We will thus aim to expand our cash flows in order to improve our overall financial position with the ultimate aim of achieving sustain- able growth and the further enhancement of our corporate value.
  Please tell us about your policy on capital expenditures.

 Breakdown of Fiscal 2020 Financial Results
Despite various difficulties in the first half of the year, we strove to seize opportunities arising from recovery in demand in the second half, ral- lying the combined strength of our entire group to expand sales and increase profit. Consequently, while sales revenue and business profit totaled ¥790.8 billion and ¥43.4 billion, down 11% and 20% year- on-year, respectively, operating profit stood at ¥38.7 billion, up 17%. Moreover, profit attributable to owners of the parent company came to ¥22.6 billion, up 87% compared with the previous fiscal year.
Sales revenue declined considerably due to a significant deterio- ration in the overall sales environment, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and business profit similarly decreased. On the other hand, operating profit and profit attributable to the owners of the parent company grew year-on-year thanks to such factors as a substantial decrease in the amount of impairment losses on good- will and noncurrent assets compared with the previous fiscal year.
Financial results by business segment are as described below.
Tire Business: Sales revenue totaled ¥679.9 billion, down 11% year-on-year, while business profit amounted to ¥40.9 billion, down 12% year-on-year. Due to the fallout from the COVID-19 pan- demic, demand was extremely sluggish in the first half of the year. However, we strove to seize opportunities arising from the recovery in market conditions that began from the second half, rallying the combined strength of our entire group to expand sales. As a result, we succeeded in improving sales revenue in the second half to a level equivalent to 97% of our revenue figures from the same period of the previous fiscal year, largely regaining ground lost since the onset of the pandemic. Moreover, our business profit in the second half was 123% of our profit figures from the same period of the pre- vious fiscal year, representing a year-on-year increase of ¥7.9 billion.
Our Stance on Shareholder Returns
We consider the return of gains to shareholders to be a matter deserving of the utmost priority. Accordingly, our basic policy is to ensure a long-term, stable stream of shareholder returns based on comprehensive consideration of dividend payout ratios, performance prospects, retained earnings levels and other such indicators on a consolidated basis. We also fully intend to utilize our retained earnings as a means of securing funds for capital expendi- tures, R&D and other forward-looking investments with the aim of expanding our group’s earnings base well into the future.
Nevertheless, the decline in our first-half performance was such that these upturns in the second half were insufficient to fully offset our poor showing in the first half. Thus, our annual sales revenue and business profit were both down in year-on-year terms.
Sports Business: Sales revenue totaled ¥70.3 billion, down 17% compared with the previous fiscal year, while overall business losses totaled ¥0.7 billion. Fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic caused demand for golf goods and tennis equipment to plummet in the first half of the year, leading to a significant decrease in sales of these products. As such, annual sales revenue was down sig- nificantly in year-on-year terms. As a result, our Sports Business ultimately posted a loss in fiscal 2020. Looking at our second-half results, however, we saw a steady recovery in overseas sales, with business profit in the second half growing compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Industrial and Other Products Business: Sales revenue amounted to ¥40.7 billion, a figure that is virtually unchanged from the previous fiscal year. Business profit was ¥3.2 billion, down 7% year-on-year. Sales of rubber parts for medical applications and vibration control dampers remained steady. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw growing demand for rubber gloves and other positive factors that bolstered sales growth. On the other hand, our business was also negatively affected by a decrease in sales of precision rubber parts for office equipment as manufactur- ers of printers and photocopiers reduced production volume as well as various other negative factors arising out of the pandemic.
Taking all of the above factors into account, our annual consoli- dated business profit was ¥43.4 billion, down 20%, or ¥11.0 billion, year-on-year.
As for the year-end dividend for fiscal 2020, we decided to pay ¥35 per share, up ¥10 per share from our initial dividend forecast of ¥25 per share, which we had announced alongside our finan- cial results for the first nine months of the year. Our current plan for fiscal 2021 calls for paying annual dividends of ¥50 per share, comprising an interim dividend of ¥20 per share and a year-end dividend of ¥30 per share.
Looking ahead, we will strive to ensure stable shareholder returns throughout our business management and operations.

tangible changes in employee behavior, with a great number of individu- als becoming adept at utilizing their ties with interdepartmental peers as well as swifter at executing their duties. In addition, we have seen steady progress in the development of measures aimed at generating greater cash and profit thanks to a total of more than 4,000 employee proposals.
In 2021, our plans call for expanding the scope of the BTC Project to include improving and strengthening the business strategy planning pro- cess as well as formulating measures to generate growth opportunities via the use of a selection and concentration approach. By doing so, we will push ahead further with reinforcing our business foundations.
  Launching 360-Degree Feedback Sessions for All Individuals in Managerial Positions, Including the President
 The BTC Project is intended to create a corporate culture that empowers diverse human resources to earn success via organizational transformation. As part of efforts to create such a culture, in 2020 Sumitomo Rubber
Industries introduced a system in which all individuals in managerial or higher positions, including the President, take part in mandatory 360-degree feedback sessions. With the aim of continuously upgrad- ing their approaches, mindsets and skills for better leadership, these individuals are presented with anonymous feedback from their team members, colleagues and leaders that they are asked to study in depth.
In addition, e-learning and other skill-enhancement programs are avail- able to individuals who voluntarily apply for supplementary training to address skills-related issues identified via the feedback sessions.
Moreover, we maintain boost programs that take a cross-hierarchy approach. These programs are designed to address essential matters requiring unified understanding among all employees throughout the organization, such as how to put “Our Philosophy”—our new corporate philosophy structure—into practice, while helping to improve their problem- solving capabilities.
  Ensuring That Our Vision Is Embraced by All and Enhancing Employee Understanding of Diversity
 We have defined our Vision—the state to which we aspire and a com- ponent of Our Philosophy—as “Uniting our diverse strengths, growing together, driving and thriving on change.” To realize this Vision, efforts are currently under way to promote diversity & inclusion (D&I). Specifically, we aim to foster a corporate culture that empowers people with diverse back- grounds, such as women, foreign nationals, people with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ community, to earn success. To this end, we are striving to enhance the understanding of diversity among all employees.
Thus far, initiatives in this area include the distribution of messages from the President addressing D&I topics and Work Style Reform with the intention of conveying a policy of simultaneously promoting the creation of a culture that respects diversity and the digitalization of operations. We have also hosted mandatory lectures for all managers to help raise their awareness of unconscious bias, which could constitute a barrier to D&I. In addition, in an effort to help all employees, regardless of rank, properly understand these matters, we have provided seminars with similar coverage. We are also aware that the removal of barriers inhibit- ing women’s success is a matter of particular importance among diver- sity issues. Accordingly, we have raised the ratio of female managers
from 1.3% in 2010 to 3.5% in 2020 and, although this ratio surpasses the rubber industry’ average, we are engaged in initiatives to double this ratio to 7% by in 2025, knowing that the representation of women in our workforce must be improved further.
In fiscal 2021, we formulated an advisory team consisting of female employees from various departments. This team is striving to identify rel- evant workplace issues and develop new proposals in a way that heeds the voices of women serving as active components of our workforce. In addition, preparations are under way to introduce a mentoring system that provides female employees with career development assistance via dialogue with their more experienced peers within the Company.
Thanks to these and other initiatives, in fiscal 2009 we became the first company in the tire industry to be certified for the “Kurumin” mark based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next- Generation Children. Since then, in 2019 we were granted “L-boshi (sec- ond level)” certification, which is given by the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare only to businesses that have superior arrangements for encouraging the active participation of women. Moreover, we were grant- ed the upgraded “L-boshi” (third level) certification in November 2020.

The Sumitomo Rubber Group’s Approach to Value Creation
  Identifying Priority Issues and Promoting Dialogue with Stakeholders
Taking into account international guidelines and stakeholders’ views, we determined priority issues to be tackled through our activities.
Having determined priorities in the indicators of the Activity Guidelines, we will push ahead further with these initiatives.
    Priority Issue Identification Process
Our organized efforts to energize sustainability activities and become a corporate group deserving of society’s trust date back more than a decade. In fiscal 2008, we formulated our Activity Basic Philosophy along with Activity Guidelines that specified five areas, namely, “Green (Green initiative),” “Ecology (Ecological pro- cess),” “Next (Next-generation product development),” “Kindness (Kindness to employees)” and “Integrity (Integrity for stakeholders),” comprising 13 indicators.
In fiscal 2011, we identified the priority issues among these 13 indicators in light of their materiality.
In fiscal 2014, we worked to update these priority issues, taking into account changes in the business environment and resulting impacts on stakeholders and society.
In fiscal 2015, we further refined the priority of the issues to be addressed with reference to the requirements of the “GRI Guidelines (G4)*” and based on a survey of various stakeholders.
Embarking on fiscal 2021, we merged together “Achieving a good work-life balance” and “Promoting diversity” into “Promoting diversity & inclusion.” This current total of 18 indicators has again been updated according to priority.
This report presents the results of efforts aimed at attaining our
targets for each indicator.
* Global Reporting Initiative: An international organization that issues CSR reporting guide- lines. Currently issues the GRI Standards.
18 Indicators Included in “GENKI” Activity Guidelines and Priority Issues
Stakeholder Dialogue
We periodically carry out surveys to learn about the various opinions and expectations of stakeholders, and, while taking their views into account, we also place importance on daily dialogue with stakeholders in pursuing our business activities.
We are conscious of our responsibilities towards stakeholders, and are working to promote communications through a variety of means.

  Launch of the verification testing of a tire
pressure management solution service
We have launched the verification testing of a solution service that remotely monitors and manages tire pressure and temperature.
The aim of this testing is to verify the feasibility of such service using 30 leased vehicles and 500 rental cars offered by partner companies. Specifically, the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) is attached to the tires of these vehicles while they operate in Fukuoka, Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures in order to collect and transfer data on their tire pressure and tire temperature to the cloud database. This service thus enables the remote confirmation of tire conditions and is expected to mitigate the maintenance workload in addition to helping operators maintain appropriate tire pressure—a key factor for sustaining fuel efficiency—thereby con- tributing to safe and secure driving.
The development of a remote tire pressure monitoring system for Level 4 autonomous vehicles;
verification testing conducted in Gifu City using public roads
Targeting Level 4 autonomous vehicles, we have developed a system for collecting tire pressure data and supporting timely response to abnormalities indicating the need for tire maintenance. In November 2020, this system underwent verification testing using public roads in Gifu City, Gifu Prefecture. The system was developed via joint research that was launched in 2019 and involves Gunma University’s Center for Research on Adoption of NextGen Transportation Systems (CRANTS), with the aim of making it possible to remotely monitor the tire pressure of unmanned vehicles operating autonomous- ly. Assuming various types of incidents, including a flat tire while under way, this system is expected to help prevent the occurrence of tire-related issues via predictive maintenance and otherwise support earlier troubleshooting.

Our group is equipped with agile reflexes to adjust course in response to changes in the business environment without losing momen- tum, and I believe that this ability to take swift action is one of our greatest strengths. Under the New Normal, business practices are undergoing some major changes, as are the links that connect us with our customers. In response to these changes, our group is now rapidly pushing ahead with various initiatives to take full advantage of DX (Digital Transformation), not only to optimize costs, but also as a means of promoting greater mutual understanding with our customers and building more solid common ground between us.
How do you hope to go about realizing your group’s new Corporate Philosophy Framework: “Our Philosophy?”
As expressed in our DUNLOP Brand Message: “In the Hope of Making Every Day Accident Free,” our Tire Business aims to provide “joy and well-being for all” by manufacturing and selling tires that contribute to the creation of an automotive society that provides great- er all-around safety and peace of mind.
Toward this end, we have been working hard to develop tires that feature superior performance in terms of both safety and environ- mental friendliness, tires that provide longer lasting safety performance and even tires that can actively avoid hazards—all backed by the innovative technologies of our SMART TYRE CONCEPT. By providing tires that not only ensure safer, more comfortable mobility for all drivers, but that are also more environmentally friendly, we hope to contribute to the realization of the Mobility Society of the Future.

Sustainability Activities Undertaken by the Sumitomo Rubber Group
  Golf Equipment
   We offer three brands, namely “XXIO,” “SRIXON” and “Cleveland Golf,” on a global scale.
Since their launch in 2000, our mainstay “XXIO” brand golf clubs have enjoyed favorable user reviews based on their carry, ease of hitting and the pleasing sound they produce when the ball is hit. The 11th generation models, “XXIO Eleven” and “XXIO X-eks-,” were launched in December 2019, and their sales are currently growing at home and abroad.
In 2020, we released the “SRIXON ZX series” for serious golfers as well as the “Cleveland RTX ZIPCORE Wedge” designed specifically for players who seek to improve their approach shots to a level equivalent to that of profes- sional golfers. We also support the performance of top-notch players with these and other golfing gear in line with equipment sponsorship agreements.
Having incorporated its cutting-edge proprietary technology into England’s traditional “DUNLOP” brand, the Company is introducing the brand throughout the world as one for all athletes, ranging from top professionals to beginners.
Not only does the Company manufacture the long-selling balls used in many of the major tournaments in Japan, it was chosen to be the official ball supplier to the Australian Open in 2019, becoming the first Japanese company to supply balls to one of the Grand Slam tournaments.
Now in the process of expansion with the aim of becoming a third pillar of business, the wellness business comprises a fitness club business and golf and tennis school businesses. In addition to the existing school business and comprehensive fitness clubs, the busi-
ness supports health promotion in a broad range of fields through such operations as compact gyms open 24 hours a day and the contracted management of local govern- ment sports facilities.

  Messages from Corporate Leadership
Right now, the COVID-19 Pandemic continues with no end in sight. In light of these circumstances, how does the Sumitomo Rubber Group plan to harness your strengths toward accomplishing the Midterm Plan under the New Normal while looking ahead to the coming Post-COVID World?
While the sporting goods industry has been severely impacted by the pandemic, I also feel that it has given many people a renewed sense of the importance of sports as a pathway to living a fuller and healthier life. As a sport that is played outdoors and has no problems accommodating social distancing, golf, in particular, is enjoying a resurgence in popularity, which has brought many young golfers and families to the sport.
Moving forward, while remaining keenly in tune with these and other market changes, we will work to establish a new business style that is well adapted to the New Normal, which will involve enhancing our e-commerce capabilities and so forth. Our major strengths include our “materials and material simulation technology,” “precision measuring technology” and “solutions development capabilities,” and we will be working to further augment these strengths in order to enhance our responsiveness to the needs of our customers while continuing to provide second-to-none products with ever greater speed.
How do you hope to go about realizing your group’s new Corporate Philosophy
Framework: “Our Philosophy?”
As a key tenet of “Our Philosophy,” our group has set forth the reason for our existence (i.e., our “Purpose”) thusly: “Through innova- tion we will create a future of joy and well-being for all.” For our Sports Business, creating “well-being” means providing products and services that are thoroughly safe in order to engender peace of mind while at the same time earning the trust of our customers, all backed by the strength of our technical capabilities and our unwavering commitment to quality.
And, when it comes to “joy,” through our products and services, our Sports Business will continue striving to give more and more people the thrill and satisfaction that come from playing an excellent game, as well as the sense of fulfillment that is an intrinsic bene- fit of sports in general.

     Raising our monthly production capacity for thin nitrile rubber gloves to 2 million pairs in
response to a government request
In response to a government request, we have decided to raise our monthly production capacity for thin nitrile rubber gloves to 2 million pairs and, to this end, expanded our facilities at the Malaysia Factory. With the expanded facilities brought on line in May 2021, we will supply these gloves to such cus- tomers as domestic healthcare institutions and food processing facilities.
The Group’s glove business is serving markets at home and abroad via the Malaysia Factory, which has just undergone facility augmentation, as well as partner factories in Thailand and elsewhere. Thin nitrile rubber gloves are used for a variety of applications, including healthcare and food processing. In addition, we have donated 97,500 pairs of such gloves to the Japanese government in April 2020 to support healthcare institutions.
Moreover, we have secured robust funds for the aforementioned facility expansion in the form of subsidies granted by the Japanese government under a scheme to promote the diversification of overseas supply chains.
 To accommodate future demand, we will continuously strive to secure an even more stable supply structure.

     The Sumitomo Rubber Group’s Approach to Value Creation
 Key Management Resources
In addition to financial capital, we regard manufactured capital (such as factories and production facilities), diverse human capital, intellectual capital (including research & development capabilities and intellectual prop- erty), social capital (e.g., global brand capability) and natural capital (such as energy resources) as key man- agement resources.
In this section, we provide a brief discussion of our approach to the different types of capital, and their cur- rent status.
Manufactured Capital (production infrastructure, capital expenditures)
The Group, which is expanding its business globally, possesses six domestic bases and 16 overseas bases in its production network. In fiscal 2020, we implemented a total of ¥41.9 billion in capital expenditures.
    Financial Capital (financial position)
For the Group, sound financial capital is a key management resource that supports sustainable growth. Total assets at the end of fiscal 2020 were ¥974.8 billion and total equity was ¥467.1 billion.

Securing Liquidity
Going forward, the Group’s policy is to continue its program of capital expenditures for the purpose of increasing production capacity in order to support the expansion of sales, primarily overseas. While increasing sales volumes and improving profit- ability so as to expand cash flows from operating activities, we will also utilize funding from financial markets and institutions, etc., as required, seeking a balance between growth on the one hand and securing liquidity and improving our financial position on the other. Through these endeavors, we will strive to achieve a D/E Ratio below 0.5 times in line with our Midterm Plan, which was announced on February 13, 2020.

Capital Expenditures
 Financial Position
Total assets at the end of fiscal 2020 were ¥974.8 billion, a decrease of ¥60.7 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year. Current assets fell ¥23.4 billion due to declines in inventories, while restraints on investment and a decrease in property, plant and equipment reflecting foreign exchange effects led to a
decrease of ¥37.3 billion in non-current assets.
Total liabilities at the end of fiscal 2020 were ¥507.7 billion,
a decrease of ¥52.2 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year. Interest-bearing debt came to ¥276.7 billion, falling ¥48.8 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year.
Total equity at the end of fiscal 2020 was ¥467.1 billion, of which total equity attributable to owners of parent was ¥454.7 bil- lion, for a ratio of equity attributable to owners of parent of 46.6%. Equity attributable to owners of parent per share was ¥1,729.05.
As a rule, the companies of the Group each take into account medium-term demand forecasts, production plans and the ratio of investment to profit, formulating their capital expenditures accordingly. In the case of important plans, the Company takes the central role in coordinating the Group, primarily for the pur- pose of optimization.
In fiscal 2020, the Group restrained capital investment due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Capital expen- diture thus amounted to ¥41.9 billion, a decrease of ¥16.2 billion year on year. Depreciation was ¥49.3 billion, a ¥2.5 billion decrease from the previous fiscal year.
For fiscal 2021, plans call for capital expenditure totaling ¥59.0 billion. We will expand investment in overseas factories to boost their production output, reversing the restrained pol- icy exercised in fiscal 2020. At the same time, we will invest in domestic factories to promote a shift to advanced product manufacturing lines. (For more details, please refer to page 18.)

The Sumitomo Rubber Group’s Approach to Value Creation
 Key Management Resources
Production Infrastructure
Tire Business
Establishing a globally optimized production infrastructure
The development of the Tire Business’s global production infra- structure began in 1997 with the Indonesia Factory, and the number of production bases continued to expand steadily with the opening of the Changshu Factory in China in 2004, the Thailand Factory in 2006 and the Hunan Factory in China in 2012. To fur- ther strengthen the supply infrastructure, we are currently moving forward with plans to extend the Thailand Factory into one of the largest of its kind in the world. In addition, we are moving steadily ahead with the expansion and enhancement of other production facilities and have launched, for example, production at the Brazil Factory and South Africa Factory in 2013 as well as at the Turkey Factory in 2015 and have acquired a factory in New York state to serve as the Group’s U.S. base.
Increasing competitiveness via a global production infrastructure
Taking full advantage of the capacities afforded by our facto- ries around the globe, we will push ahead a shift to a structure in which products are manufactured near their target markets. Simultaneously, we will supplement product supply by charging our Thailand Factory—the world’s largest facility of its kind and a source of strength for the Group—to ensure that any underserved demand across the world can be met.
Status of Our Global Production and Sales Bases
Through these efforts, we will establish relationship of trust with automakers. This will, in turn, help us raise the number of original equipment tires we supply and secure robust sales in the replace- ment market. In these ways, we solidify our business foundation.
Geographically, our production infrastructure already boasts low- cost manufacturing bases in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. And, in line with changing market needs, we have begun replacing facilities to raise our SUV tire production capacity. Looking ahead, we will continuously strive to maintain stable sales in Japan and China and secure robust sources of profit.
Looking at Europe and Africa, our Turkey Factory, a supply base for the former, is steadily ramping up production. Via this factory, we will fully leverage scale merits to stably increase the volume of products delivered to European automakers while expanding sales of replacement tires. With regard to the South Africa Factory, we will promote productivity improvement as well as a shift to high- value-added products.
In the Americas, we have seen stable sales growth in North America. Recently, we decided to invest in the USA Factory as well as in the Japan and Thailand factories—our export bases—in an effort to raise these facilities’ production output. This investment will boost our regional supply capacity for SUV and other tires, with both U.S.A-made and imported products supporting our lineup. In Brazil, we have made progress in securing sufficient local produc- tion for local consumption by raising our production capacity in the region. As such, we are striving to develop a stable profit base.
Human Capital (number of employees, fostering human resources, promoting Work Style Reform)
The basic aim of the Group is to respect the human rights of employees, fostering a workplace environment in which every- one feels safe, respected and free to engage in the open exchange of ideas and is encouraged to take on challenging tasks. In line with this, we are striving to create a corporate culture that supports employee efforts to achieve personal growth in step with the Group’s business growth.

Basic Perspective on Human Resource Development
The Group fosters human resources through a combination of three components: OffJT such as group training, etc., OJT at each division, and self-study. We believe that to develop robust human resources, we must start with helping employees be aware of what they need to learn. In particular, we provide young employees with grade-specific career vision training designed to help them envision their desired future and thereby identify the types of skills they need to acquire. This training also involves supplementary programs for those who voluntarily take on further learning. Although the majority of the above training programs were undertaken in the form of online seminars in 2020, we will continue to enhance our training systems in a way that takes full advantage of the features of online, in-person and e-learning.
Regarding the systematic execution of human resource devel- opment, we are promoting a variety of training programs to enable employees to improve their skills, with the Human Resources Development Department and the Manufacturing Education Department playing a central role.
As for the fostering of global human resources, we are strength- ening efforts overseas, aiming to ensure identical product quality irrespective of the factory in which manufacturing takes place, so that all employees are able to grow and to feel job satisfaction.
Our manufacturing education emphasizes manufacturing tech- nology and craftsmanship in Japan and overseas.
In workplace supervisor training, the focus is on putting what has been learned to practical use. To raise the level of workplace man- agement, we are conducting various activities aimed at establishing a consistent, Group-wide philosophy embraced by all employees across the Group.
Respect for Human Rights
Basic Perspective on Consideration for Human Rights
Our Corporate Code of Conduct states that we “maintain a sound working environment free from discrimination on the basis of belief, creed, religion, race, skin color, nationality, language, social background, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, phys- ical handicap or other reason.” Accordingly, we strive to prevent infringement of human rights of any employee.
Furthermore, a handbook on human resource and labor manage- ment has been distributed to all those in managerial positions. We also help raise their awareness of relevant topics via training and lecture sessions. In these ways, we are striving to create a working environment that tolerates no human resource violations or harass- ment and empowers every employee to work energetically.

Guided by the underlying concept of “What tire technology can do for the global environment,” the Tire Business focuses its R&D efforts on developing environmentally friendly products by focus- ing on three areas: “innovative materials,” “fuel efficiency,” and “resource conservation.” The Tire Technical Center, located near the Kobe Head Office, serves as the core facility for these initiatives, which it pursues in collaboration with the Europe and USA Tire Technical Centers.
In line with our particular focus on developing tires boasting superior safety performance as well as capabilities that help reduce
Topics
environmental burden, we have been engaged in cutting-edge research initiatives, including an R&D project that has been under way since 2012 in which we perform large-scale simulations using the K computer to create innovative rubber materials.
In the Sports Business, having established R&D sections at both the Sports Business HQ and Roger Cleveland Golf Company, Inc. in the USA, we are developing, evaluating, and testing new technol- ogies and products by employing computer simulations and other technologies.
In the Industrial and Other Products Business, we are actively developing new products aimed at accommodating consumer needs in such fields as vibration control units using high-damping rubber parts for medical applications and precision rubber parts for office equipment.
      Topics
  Winning an HPCI* Excellent Achievement Award in recognition of large scale molecular dynamics
simulations of rubbers for tires *High Performance Computing Infrastructure
The Company was chosen to receive an HPCI Excellent Achievement Award in recognition of its research effort employing the K computer to perform large scale molecular dynamics simulations of rubbers for tires.
Through this research, we have discovered the mechanism by which the form of cohesion between silica and coupling agents, both acting as rubber additives, affects the strength of the resulting rubber material. These findings, in turn, helped us yield positive results in terms of improvement in abrasion resistance. Looking ahead, we will take advantage of these simulation results in the development of new rubber materials and products.
In addition, as we aim to push ahead with efforts to create tires capable of realizing both a superior safety performance and a lower environmental footprint, we will also employ Fugaku, a supercomputer designed as the successor to the K computer and made available for shared use since 2021, to advance simulation-based tire development.
In June 2020, the Izumiotsu Factory concluded a temporary evacuation agreement with Izumiotsu City to provide its premises as shelters in the event of a disaster. Specifically, the factory will open its gymnasium, parking lot and bathing and other facilities to evacuees. An agreement of this kind is at the vanguard of community contribu- tion on a nationwide basis. In September 2020, the factory carried out evacuation drills in the presence of Osaka Prefectural Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura and, in November, executed drills for the installation of a temporary shelter in tandem with city officials and residents of neighboring communities. Also, during the period from May 2020 to March 2021, the factory donated disinfectants to the city which, in turn, distributed them to local ele- mentary and middle schools.
Going forward, we will work hand in hand with members of neighboring communities to ensure that robust countermeasures are in place in preparation for disasters.

       Intellectual Property Strategies
The Group proactively carries out intellectual property activities that support its businesses.
Specifically, the Group undertakes intellectual property activities focusing on three pillars, namely: 1) “securing intellectual property rights” with regard to such industrial properties as patents, util- ity models, designs and trademarks; 2) “exercising such rights” against the infringement of Sumitomo Rubber Industries’ intellec- tual properties; and 3) “eliminating risk” by developing a structure to defend against attacks by third parties. In step with the rapid expansion of its overseas operations, the scope of the Group’s intellectual property activities is growing worldwide, encompass- ing not only Japan but also the United States, Europe and such Asian countries as China, as well as Russia and countries in South
America, the Middle East and Africa.
Efforts are now under way to nurture human resources and rein-
force our structure to conduct intellectual property activities that go along with such globalization. In particular, the Group is providing training sessions not only for Intellectual Property Department members but also for employees at every operational base with the aim of raising awareness of intellectual property and upgrading the competencies of the entire workforce. Such action is facilitating the development of a structure that ensures intellectual property activities are carried out smoothly and seamlessly on a Group-wide basis. In particular, we are focusing on acquiring more effective rights by assigning IP representatives to Europe.
Focusing on the above-mentioned three pillars, the Group will promote the more efficient implementation of intellectual property activities at a global level.
Enhancing Our Brand Capabilities
Our brand capabilities constitute one of essential elements sup- porting growth in corporate value. For us to take full advantage of the Dunlop brand and maximize business outcomes, we need to make collective efforts that rally all kinds of Group resources. With

*Not including the provision of seedlings
  In response to the problem of climate change, the Group is working to reduce its products’ CO2 emissions over their entire life cycles, from raw material procurement to final disposal.
In addition to taking steps to reduce CO2 emissions during the use of a tire, which accounts for approximately 85% of its life-cycle CO2 emissions, in 2018 we began working with raw material suppliers to ascertain and reduce their CO2 emissions. Also, in terms of reducing CO2 emitted in the course of busi- ness activities (Scopes 1 & 2), we are working on initiatives involving switching fuel types, installing cogeneration systems, promoting general energy-saving activities, and utilizing renew- able energy from solar power and other green energy sources.
Building a Recycling-Oriented Society
In response to the problem of waste, we are taking steps to control the amount of waste generated, to convert it to some- thing of value, and to promote recycling. As part of these efforts, since 2010 we have been striving to achieve zero emissions at our major bases both in Japan and overseas by reducing landfill waste to zero and moving to 100% reuse of resources.
To conserve water resources, we are making efforts to reduce water usage and promoting recycling. In 2019, the Turkey Factory achieved a wastewater recycling rate of 100%. Our natural rubber processing factory in Thailand also recycles 100% of its wastewater. Our plans call for extending wastewa- ter recycling to other factories, including those in China.
We are promoting greening initiatives at our sites and the areas surrounding them, both in Japan and overseas. On the subject of promoting biodiversity, the Company is involved in such pro- grams as the “Acorn Project,” the goal of which is to conserve genetic biodiversity, and in the creation of biotopes.
Promoting Environmental Footprint Management
In order to reduce emissions of chemical substances, we are implementing measures to cut the release and transfer of chemicals subject to PRTRs, as well as conducting activities to reduce the amount of organic solvent waste produced.
Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy
On November 16, 2018, we announced our “Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy” with the aim of making natural rubber a sustainable resource. In line with this policy, we seek to resolve issues in regions where natural rubber is produced, such as environmental problems caused by the destruction of forests, and human rights problems in the working environment.
In September 2020, we participated in the second General Assembly of the GPSNR* as one of 64 member corpora- tions and organizations. Looking ahead, we will update our Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy to reflect a policy framework
approved by this General Assembly. *Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber

Green initiative
Management Approach
Forests absorb CO2, which contributes to global warming, and are an important component of the social infrastructure that preserves biodiversity. Based on the concept that preserving this infrastruc- ture is one of our corporate social responsibilities, we promote “Green (Green initiative)” through ongoing tree planting activities in and around our operation bases within Japan and overseas.
In fiscal 2009, we began tree-planting activities at our facilities in Japan and overseas. As of the end of 2020, we had planted a cumulative total of 1,760,000 trees. We will continue to plant trees while participating in forest maintenance.

       Forestation Activities to Help Curb Global Warming
Connecting with Local Communities via Forestation Activities
 Collaborative Activities with Local Residents in “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest”
The objectives of forestation activities include the prevention of global warming by absorption of CO2, landslide prevention, and biodiversity preservation. We also consider communicating with local communities through satoyama (working forests that are maintained and managed by humans) conservation activities, another important objective.
Initiatives to Preserve Biodiversity
The Group is involved in conservation activities in relation to endan- gered, near threatened, and rare species (five species of animal and 16 species of plant) at all eight of its sites in Japan, consisting of six factories, the Head Office and the Tire Proving Ground.
In terms of contributing to the immediate neighborhood, activities include transplanting “Fujibakama” (Eupatorium japonicum) cultivat- ed in the grounds of our factory to river beds, as well as providing this plant to neighboring cities. We also provide kindergarten chil- dren with the opportunity to observe Sasakia charonda, which is designated as a national butterfly. In 2020, this butterfly successfully emerged on the premises of the Okayama Tire Proving Ground. Also in 2020, we began working on the preservation of Lilium japonicum.
On the premises of the Okayama Tire Proving Ground, a Sasakia charonda (Nymphalidae family) butterfly, which is designated by Okayama Prefecture as a species requiring partic- ular interest, emerges successfully for the first time
To align our forestation activities with the circumstances unique to each local community, we promote activities in which employ- ees, former employees,
families, friends, local
residents and regional
organizations partici-
pate. In 2020, we pro-
vided a total of 5,031
seedlings to green ini-
tiative organizations and
the people of neighbor-
ing communities.
In September 2013, the Sumitomo Rubber Group launched the Team ENASAVE Future Project in cooperation with the National Federation of UNESCO Associations in Japan (NFUAJ). This project aims to ensure that Japan’s beautiful cultural and natural heritages are passed down to future generations for the next 100 years. As part of this project, we engage in environmental protection activities in tandem with people from communities across the nation.
Having started with one location in 2013, we have expanded the number of locations where these annual activities are held from eight in 2014 to 10 in 2019. The locations are scattered throughout Japan and take place with the help of employees, their families, and local associations as well as volunteers from the public. In 2020, however, our activities were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

  “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest,” a Green Initiative in Japan
In addition to the grounds of our facilities, we engage in forestation activities in the surrounding area and at the 11 locations (23 ha) in Japan designated as “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest.”
When planting trees, one has to be aware of the negative effect non-native species can have on local ecosystem. As such, we plant only seedlings grown from acorn seeds that employees and their fami- lies gather in the target area. Our continued efforts are aimed at increas- ing the amount of greenery around us while protecting biodiversity.
Although our activities in fiscal 2020 were somewhat restricted due to the need to prevent the risk of COVID-19 infection, 938 trees were planted in “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest” in said fiscal year.
Maintenance work after tree planting is also important for forestation. Accordingly, we constantly carry out such tasks as cutting back weeds, removing vines, removing unnecessary trees, pruning and thinning.

Greening Initiatives Overseas
We are promoting greening initiatives at overseas factories and sales companies. In fiscal 2020, due to the need to prevent COVID- 19 infection, these Group entities faced restrictions on their activi- ties as did our Japanese bases. However, a total of 902 trees have been planted and 2,105 seedlings provided.
In addition, 15,000 trees were planted in Indonesia through the “Team ENASAVE Green Project,” wherein mangrove seedlings are planted using some of the proceeds from sales of the fuel-efficient “ENASAVE” tire series. Furthermore, 2,400 trees were planted through the “1 Pair for 1 Love activities,” in which some of the pro- ceeds from the sales of rubber gloves are allocated to the DUNLOP Home Products Forest on the island of Borneo, Malaysia, in order to protect the orangutan, an endangered species.

  Participating in a biodiversity symposium—helping rediscover
the natural beauty of the Rokko mountain range environment
Celebrating the 80th anniversary of the commencement of its construction, in 2021 Kobe Municipal Arboretum hosted a symposium in tandem with Kobe City, with the aim of com- municating the natural beauty of the environment of Mount Rokko. The symposium was held from January 29 to March 31, 2021, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was made accessible to the public only via the internet.
Having participated in the event in the category of biodiversity-related presentations focused on Mount Rokko, we exhibited materials showcasing green initiatives undertaken by the Sumitomo Rubber Group. This event provided us with a good opportunity to let a broad range of the general public know about our locally-rooted green initiatives that exemplify the variety of activities that can contribute to a sustainable society, energize neighboring commu- nities, and protect the global environment.

CO2 Emissions Reduction Activities in Production Bases
In fiscal 2020, we had to temporarily suspend operations at some factories due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we were thus unable to sufficiently implement energy-saving activities, we strove to launch new energy-saving measures by putting into practice insights offered by consultants in fiscal 2019. As a result, CO2 emis- sions from production activities at the Group’s factories in Japan decreased by 6 kt-CO2 to 265 kt-CO2 from the previous fiscal year.
However, the environmental impact indicator of CO2 emissions showed an 18.9% increase from the previous fiscal year.
In fiscal 2021, the Company will work on the predictive mainte- nance of facilities and on reducing CO2 through such initiatives as deploying AI and IoT platforms to search for, extract, and analyze factors that affect energy savings.

   Environmental preservation is one of the most important responsi- bilities that companies must fulfill within a global society.
There are strong demands that global companies implement uni- form environmental management throughout the world regardless of country or region.
As it accelerates its global expansion, the Sumitomo Rubber Group is focusing ever more energy on promoting global environ- mental management.
The Sumitomo Rubber Group established its Environmental Policy in July 2007 and revised said policy in April 2019, putting it into practice via environmental initiatives.
49 Integrated Report 2021
In order to strengthen global environmental management, the Global Environmental Management Central Committee, which is composed primarily of responsible parties at bases in Japan and overseas and individuals responsible for issue-specific working groups, meets twice a year.
In 2020, the committee met in February and July. At these meetings, there were reports by representatives from domestic and overseas manufacturing factories on a wide range of activities, including actual results and improvements in various indicators such as CO2 emissions, energy savings, waste disposal and water usage, as well as efforts to improve the environment (odors, etc.) and contribution to society. Also, the Hybrid Rubber Products Division reported on its environmental initiatives, while CSR-related departments reported on their efforts to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) via the promotion of ESG-oriented management. Thus, attendees at both meetings engaged in active discussion on these matters.
In 2021, the committee was renamed the Sustainability Promotion Committee to indicate a shift to stronger focus on ESG-oriented man- agement. The committee will engage in the follow-up monitoring of initiatives aimed at addressing priority

   CO2 Emissions Reduction in Logistics
In fiscal 2020, we worked to increase the modal shift rate by raising the precision of demand forecasts and ensuring scheduled ship- ments for marine and train transportation.
CO2 emissions from transporting tires fell 16.6% compared to the previous fiscal year, to 24.1 kt-CO2, and the environmental impact indicator fell 3.3%.
In fiscal 2021, we will work on optimizing the location of our production sites and reducing the number of products transported from one warehouse to another.
Building a Recycling-Oriented Society
Items marked with “ ” have been verified by third parties. The environmental impact indicator was not verified by third parties. The figures shown in the graphs differ from the verified figures as different coefficients were used.
Continue to Achieve Complete Zero Landfill Waste
The Sumitomo Rubber Group is promoting the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) of waste management in order to build a recycling- oriented society.
In fiscal 2020, we achieved complete zero landfill waste for the 11th consecutive year at our major production bases both in Japan and overseas.
Complete zero landfill waste is defined as the complete diversion of landfill waste, meaning a 100% recycling rate and no waste sent directly to landfills.
In fiscal 2021, the aim of our efforts is to proceed with our mis- sion to achieve zero emissions.

recycling of wastewater has also been implemented at the Thailand Factory and the Kakogawa Factory, while the Brazil Factory and the South Africa Factory initiated the recycling of factory wastewater. Furthermore, the Indonesia Factory is moving ahead with the use of rainwater to reduce external water usage.
In 2020, total water usage at all of the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s factories was reduced by about 8.5% year on year. We will push for- ward with water usage optimization in production processes at each base and measures that utilize the results of assessments based on the WRI* Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas on an ongoing basis.

The Group has been making voluntary efforts to reduce emissions of VOCs (volatile organic compounds). In fiscal 2020, there was a decrease in the total amount of VOCs emitted due to a significant cut in production volume. On the other hand, the environmental impact indicator deteriorated substantially.
In fiscal 2021, we will strive to achieve further reduction in the quantities of VOCs used while implementing measures to curb the evaporation of these substances.

Reducing Waste Disposal*
In fiscal 2020, the Group made efforts to curb waste disposal, for example by reducing metal scrap. However, the environmental impact indicator deteriorated, reflecting the cut in production volume. * Waste disposal refers to the amount of waste diverted for the thermal/material cycle.
Water Usage Reduction
With the aim of dealing with the global shortage of water resourc- es, as a measure to reduce water usage, the Group aims to achieve a wastewater recycling rate of 100% at all 26 factories around the world by fiscal 2050. The Turkey Factory is one of those within the Group with a higher level of water stress, and has been working on trial operations to establish water-recycling technology since 2018. In the summer of 2019, it achieved 100% recycling for factory wastewater by using concentrated water from the recycling facilities to water trees on the site of the factory and to flush toilets. In accordance with the Midterm Plan, the Group is aiming to establish water-recycling technology for 100% of the wastewater from a second factory in 2021, namely the Changshu Factory in China, which also has a high level of water stress.

Underpinning the activities of the Sumitomo Rubber Group is the ques- tion “How can tires contribute to the global environment?” To this end, the Group is developing environmentally friendly products with a focus on three areas—fuel efficiency, raw materials and resource saving.
While the environment surrounding the automobile industry faces drastic changes, the Group is pushing forward with the development of environmentally friendly products based on its “ENASAVE technol- ogy,” which delivers “even higher environmental performance.”

How Can Tires Contribute to the Global Environment?
        Pursuing “Safety and Comfort,” “Economy” and “Quality”
Based on the SMART TYRE CONCEPT, our Performance Sustaining Technology has been incorporated into the “VEURO VE304” premium comfort tire. This concept also led to the release of the flagship “ENASAVE NEXT III” fuel-efficient tire. The release of these tires helped us step up our sales expansion efforts.
Both of these tires also incorporate a hydrogenated polymer that helps prevent a decline in wet grip performance while con- tributing to superior wear resistance.
The release of the “VEURO VE304” was achieved via the establishment of a technology that makes it possible to incor- porate this polymer into products designed for large volume sales. We therefore consider the “VEURO VE304” a testament to our remarkable technological advancements.
The “ENASAVE NEXT III,” on the other hand, incorporates
One of our proprietary technologies, SENSING CORE is used for detecting tire pressure, tire load, and road conditions via the use of sensors installed in tires. While this technology helps drivers assess tire conditions on a real-time basis, it can also be used to improve vehicle control and other aspects of automo- bile operations.
Value Offered
cellulose nanofiber, thereby achieving driving comfort and steer- ing stability. This product is the first in the world to incorporate cellulose nanofiber, a biomass material boasting environmental friendliness. From the viewpoint of sustainability, we believe that our success in utilizing biomass as a tire material is a matter of great significance.
We have received robust customer reviews for these products.
In addition, the “VEURO VE304” was named a Grand Prix winner under the DAILY AUTOMOTIVE NEWS Car Parts Awards 2020 program, while the “ENASAVE NEXT III” was chosen to receive multiple awards under the Eco-Pro Award program, the Super Parts Manufacturer Award program, and the Energy Conservation Grand Prize program. As such, our products are similarly lauded by external organizations.
This technology is distinctively unique as it allows the tire itself to serve as a sensor and thereby eliminates the need for the additional installation of other sensing devices as well as eliminating a great deal of maintenance.
As a testament to our SENSING CORE-based offerings, this tire pressure sensing technology has been installed in a cumu- lative total of 40 million vehicles, garnering a solid reputation.
Recently, we advanced SENSING CORE by establishing a technology for detecting the extent of tire abrasion. In addition to existing technologies for detecting tire pressure, tire load and road conditions, we will leverage this new technology for detecting tire abrasion, with the aim of making further contribu- tion to CASE, MaaS and other technological trends supporting the future advancement of a mobility society.
Developing Environmentally Friendly Products
  SMART TYRE CONCEPT
Reflecting the ongoing advance of the Mobility as a Service (MaaS) industrial trend, tire manufacturers are confronting changes in tire performance requirements as the shift from car ownership to car sharing and pooling progresses. In response, Sumitomo Rubber
Industries is striving to advance its SMART TYRE CONCEPT, which guides its efforts to create tires with ever better safety performance and environmental friendliness, as well as to develop peripheral services with an eye to meeting the needs of future generations.

Kindness
Kindness to employees Management Approach
Employees achieve satisfaction by working for the Sumitomo Rubber Group, which grows as a result of its employees’ success. To con- tinue building such a sound relationship, we believe that we have a responsibility to provide all employees with a fair and equal chance to grow through a range of benefit packages and training programs.
With the President himself leading the way, the Company is working on Work Style Reform and on activities to maintain or improve the health of employees, which it is putting into practice as a strategic priority.

In order to pursue greater happiness for all of the employees—the bedrock of our growing business—as well as their families, Sumitomo Rubber Industries and our Health Insurance Association are working together to raise awareness of one’s per- sonal responsibility to maintain one’s own health while at the same time promoting disease prevention and healthier living.
  May 2021, we brought the expanded facilities on line.
In Japan, we have maintained a policy of encouraging remote working, keeping it up even after the lifting of a state of emergency declaration and thereby curbing the number of employees at work
Initiatives to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19
  Two of our factories were chosen by prefectural governments under their programs and named, respectively, as an employee-friendly workplace and an excellent organization in terms of helping employ- ees achieve an optimal work-life balance.
Promoting Diversity
Promoting Work Style Reform and Diversity
We communicate our approach to promoting work style reform and diversity to people within and outside the Group via messages from top management. As part of our pursuit of diversity & inclusion, we will strive to foster a corporate culture in which diverse individuals are empowered to work energetically in an atmosphere of mutual respect. Through digital transformation, we also help employees discover the spare time they need to take on tasks aimed at delivering higher added value. With these two key initiatives, we will pursue happiness for all Group employees while improving our corporate value.
Also, since 2019 we made helping raise employee awareness of unconscious bias, which could constitute a barrier against diversity & inclusion, a priority. In line with this, in 2020 we held mandatory corporate ethics lectures for all managers that encouraged them to reflect on their own unconscious biases, join grade-specific dis- cussion sessions to share their takeaways with peers, and acquire deeper insights into this subject. Furthermore, we have distributed a transcript of a dialogue between President Yamamoto and a lectur- er specializing in unconscious bias. By letting employees know that the man at the top is also committed to addressing his own biases, we have drawn their attention to the importance of this issue.
In addition, we have been holding grade-specific seminars on this subject and, for 2021, we will continuously strive to help all employ- ees, regardless of their ranks, properly understand the matter.
Respecting Diversity
In order to promote Work Style Reform and diversity, in February 2019, we launched a new project within the Human Resources & General Affairs Department and Human Resources Development Department. By nurturing a corporate culture in which people from diverse backgrounds can thrive, we will generate innovations that save time through advances in operational efficiency, linking this to the satisfaction of all employees and enhanced corporate value.
For example, we eased dress restrictions in offices as part of our ongoing initiatives since 2019 to create a workplace culture that encourages free expression and independent thinking as well as the individuality of employees. We also incorporated a location-free workplace platform to vitalize employee communication.
In the course of promoting more active roles for women, the Company has set a target of raising the ratio of women in management posi- tions to 7% by the end of 2025, redefining its conventional diversity target in 2021. In order to achieve the goal of respecting diversity, we are moving forward with efforts to expand the work-life balance sys- tems so that employees who have experienced various life events can play active roles and to raise the percentage of people who take paid leave to promote reforms for a well-balanced work style.
The number of users of the “daycare support system” under which a daycare subsidy is granted to employees who leave a child under two years of age at a daycare facility, has been increasing since its introduction in 2015 as a measure to support an earlier return to work from maternity leave and/or childcare leave. The sys- tem is contributing to female employees’ career development.
Usage of the “temporary leave to accompany spouse overseas sys- tem,” whereby employees can take temporary leave to accompany their spouses when they are relocated overseas, is also progressing, and we are seeing a rising number of registrations in our “JOB Return System,” which applies in cases where marriage or a change in the spouse’s work location makes the resignation of an employee unavoidable.
For fiscal 2021, our plans call for establishing a working group that takes a cross-departmental approach to determining how to promote women’s career success and incorporating the insights the group offers to improve various human resource management measures.

     In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, which impacted regions around the world, we put the utmost priority on ensuring the safety of Group employees and their families. In addition to ensuring this priority, we focused on maintaining operations and, to this end, took every possible measure to minimize the pandemic’s effect on our operating results.
In February 2020, we established a risk control headquarters and promoted the above endeavors while facilitating information sharing on a global basis.
In the course of our business operations, we have not only striv- en to ensure employee safety but also done our utmost to secure customer safety. Along with promoting remote working, we have thus shifted to online and other alternative sales activities to prevent COVID-19 infection. Also, in April 2020 we donated 97,500 pairs of nitrile rubber gloves, one of our products, to the Japanese gov- ernment to support healthcare institutions. Moreover, in July 2020, in response to a government request we have decided to raise our annual production capacity for nitrile rubber gloves to 2 million pairs and, to this end, expanded our facilities at the Malaysia Factory. In
We launched our risk control headquarters, which is spear- heading discussion on our response to the pandemic while gathering information on a global basis. From mid-February onward, we cancelled various events set to be held thereafter.
We began recommending employees at domestic business sites to work at home to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infec- tion. For those working at overseas business sites, we issued similar recommendations in response to requests from local governments.
Due to the enforcement of a state of emergency declaration in Japan, as general rule, all domestic employees were asked to work at home. We also donated nitrile rubber gloves to the Japanese government to support healthcare institutions. As part of health-oriented management, we launched web-based healthcare sessions in which industrial physicians, health nurs- es and counselors could engage with employees.
Even after the lifting of a state of emergency declaration, we kept our focus on ensuring employee health and maintaining an employee-friendly working environment and, to this end continued to encourage remote working to curb the number of employees commuting to our offices. We have similarly encouraged those operating in overseas business sites to work at home in a manner consistent with region-specific conditions.
in our offices. Through these and other measures, we are continu- ously implementing countermeasures against COVID-19 infection in light of country-specific circumstances.
Currently, our mode of operations is changing significantly in step with the aforementioned shift to remote working. Leveraging this shift as an opportunity, we will verify the effectiveness of remote working as part of our pursuit of optimal work styles that enable us to improve productivity in a way that ensures employee health and is employee friendly.
In line with the “Health & Productivity Management Declaration” established in February 2018, the Company has worked in coop- eration with the Health Insurance Association to promote health and productivity management measures that are centered on the Health Management Office but that include the participation of all employees. As a result of establishing Health Management Regulations codifying the rules for various health checks and levels of risk and its efforts to steadily cycle through the PDCA system, in March 2020 for the first time the Company was one of 40 com- panies selected for inclusion in the “2020 Health & Productivity Stock Selection” organized by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which rec- ognizes companies that take a strategic management approach to the health management of their employees. In 2021 the Company has also been certified under the “2021 Certified Health and Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program— White 500” for the fifth consecutive year.
* We were certified as one of the 40 companies in the “2020 Health & Productivity Stock Selection Program,” in which companies that make
Strengthening the Organizational Framework
At the end of 2019, we conducted a Group-wide organizational framework survey by submitting questionnaires to every Group employee. Based on survey results, in 2020 we conducted activ- ities to enhance our organizational framework. Specifically, we implemented the following four policies: “An environment that encourages employees to take on challenges,” “An open-minded workplace without boundaries between departments or ranks,” “An environment that empowers everyone to exercise leadership,” and “Highly productive operations connected to Companywide strate- gies.” While confirming the outcomes of these activities via simple questionnaires on a quarterly basis, we are continuously engaged in efforts to achieve organizational transformation.
Human Resources Development
In order for the Company to become a truly global player, the human resources who support this effort must also be able to act as truly global players. To this end, human resource development initiatives being undertaken since 2020 to strengthen employee leadership include executive coaching programs for the President and other members of top management and 360-degree feedback sessions for those in managerial or higher positions. Furthermore, to support those who spearhead transformation, we have launched boost programs that take a cross-hierarchy approach and encom- pass a range of employees from managers to frontline workers, with the aim of establishing a unified understanding of how to pro- cess tasks and other operational issues.
In addition to promoting reductions in the amount of after-hours work performed by employees and greater use of paid leave, we are moving forward with the introduction of diverse workstyles that take into consideration childcare and nursing care in order to add variety to work and support efforts to balance work and family.
The result of these and other efforts has been that 100% of female employees who have given birth have taken childcare leave. In addition, 14 male employees took childcare leave in 2020, an increase of five people year on year.
In fiscal 2009 we became the first company in the tire indus- try to be certified for the “Kurumin” mark based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children and have since continued to support childcare. In 2019, the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare awarded the Company “L-boshi (second level)” certification, which is given only to busi- nesses that have superior arrangements for encouraging the active participation of women. Moreover, we were granted “L-boshi” (third level) certification in November 2020. We have also expanded support for nursing care through efforts ranging from launching an external nursing care consultation desk to periodically hosting nurs- ing care seminars addressing a variety of timely topics.

Aware of the social responsibilities incumbent on the Sumitomo Rubber Group, we always work to assess what is expected of us and reflect such expectations in our business activities. To this end, regular communication with our stakeholders is indispensable. As we globalize our business, we welcome a diverse range of new stakeholders around the world. We strive to demonstrate integrity in all our business activities so that we can earn the trust of all our stakeholders.

         Supply Chain Management
The Group has established its own “Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy” with the aim of making natural rubber a sustainable resource for the future that it announced in November 2018. In line with this policy, we are committed to promoting more proactive, collaborative efforts that involve both supply chains and various other stakeholders, with the objective of achieving a society in which natural rubber is a sustainable resource.
Aiming to ensure the sustainable procurement of high-quality natural rubber, we established SUMITOMO RUBBER SINGAPORE PTE. LTD. in Singapore, which boasts the world’s largest market for natural rubber, and initiated its operations in April 2020. Today, busi- nesses engaged in the procurement of natural rubber are increas- ingly being called upon to give due consideration to human rights and environmental concerns. In response to this call, Sumitomo Rubber Industries is also serving as a proactive participant in GPSNR,* an international platform founded in October 2018.
* Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber consisting mainly of tire makers, natural rubber suppliers, automakers and NGOs.
Engaging in CSR Procurement along with Suppliers
In light of the growing importance of CSR procurement, every three years we distribute CSR questionnaires that target suppliers and an ever expanding range of business partners.
In addition, we hold lectures for employees that focus on ESG issues and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the aim of helping raise employee awareness regarding com- pliance, human rights, labor, environmental and other issues.
Ensuring Thorough Compliance
We drive home to our employees the importance of avoiding all wrongful conduct through our “Corporate Code of Conduct,” which includes rules that prohibit them from engaging in monopolistic prac- tices; unfair competition or business dealings; or bribery. Employees are also required to sever any relations with anti-social forces.
Going forward, we will continue efforts aimed at improving com- pliance awareness on a Group-wide basis.
Promoting Dialogue with Stakeholders
Communication with Shareholders and Investors
The Company discloses various types of data, including business performance records, in the Investor Relations section of our corpo- rate website and holds briefings for analysts and institutional inves- tors at such times as the disclosure of earnings reports, as part of our communications (IR activities) with shareholders and investors.
The Company engages in constant communication (shareholder relations (SR) activities) with institutional investors for deeper mutual understanding and trust. In 2020, we held a total of nine SR ses- sions, a number of which were held remotely. Through such direct dialogue, the Company aims to enhance its corporate value by
providing information and participating in an exchange of opinions with a broader scope.
The Company will continue making full use of input from our shareholders and investors in enhancing its management and cor- porate value.
Sound Labor-Management Relations
The Company and the Sumitomo Rubber Labor Union (which had 5,532 general members as of December 31, 2020, exclud- ing officers or managers) maintain good relations based on the sharing of information by management and an approach of prior consultation. We believe that the growth of the Company and the pursuit of employee happiness are objectives shared by labor and management, and we have a history of productive discussions at the various labor-management committees. For example, we engage in activities in which labor and management are united in the pursuit of their objectives, such as when we organized a Labor-Management Wages Study Group comprising personnel from the union leadership and the Company’s Human Resources Department, with the aim of reviewing the human resources system and working conditions and have maintained it ever since.
In fiscal 2020, this study group was responsible for such initia- tives as the upward revision of the overtime premium rate applied to those who work during consecutive holidays that have otherwise been designated as non-business days for the general workforce in addition to the relaxation of conditions regarding applications for a paid-leave rights preservation system designed to support employ- ee livelihood.
In May 2020, we signed a Positive Impact Finance Loan Agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited, becoming the first busi- ness in the rubber product industry to be entitled to financing of this kind. This is testament to the solid reputation we have earned regarding our efforts to contribute to the realization of SDGs.
The Positive Impact Finance scheme involves the comprehensive analysis and assessment of environmental, social, and economic impacts, both positive and negative, attributable to business activ- ities undertaken by applicants. Loans are thus furnished to provide ongoing assistance, without specifying usage of funds, to those whose activities are positively evaluated.
With the signing of this agreement as a springboard, the Sumitomo Rubber Group will place even stronger emphasis on efforts aimed at contributing to SDGs in line with its ongoing policy of achieving medium- to long-term improvement in corporate value.
Contributing to Regional Communities
In 2020, the latest rounds of the Dunlop Monozukuri Class and the Dunlop Environmental Class were held in Hyogo Prefecture. We have regularly held both events since launching the former in 2009 in conjunction with the centennial of the Company’s founding, and the latter in the subsequent year. Acting in collaboration with an NPO, we are thus offering programs designed to help children experience the fun of manufacturing and familiarize them with envi- ronmental problems.
Striving to fulfill our corporate social responsibilities, we will contribute to the communities in which we operate as well as society as a whole. In these
ways, we create new value
 Promoting Initiatives That Comply with the “Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy”
 In fiscal 2021, we will continue our efforts to promote workstyle reforms, and move ahead with various activ- ities, with labor and man- agement continuing to work in cooperation with each other.
A central labor-management meeting held in December 2020
that fosters the sustainable development of society, thereby becoming a compa- ny deserving the solid trust of community members and worthy of their support.

    Building Relationships with Customers
With the aim of raising driver awareness regarding the need of periodic tire checkups, for 13 years since 2018 we have sponsored DUNLOP Nationwide Tire Safety Inspections. The latest round of this campaign was conducted in October 2020 at the Company’s directly managed stores (Tire Select and Tire Land stores) in regions across Japan.
As a result, one out of every four vehicles that had undergone inspections was found to have issues attributable to insufficient tire maintenance, such as shallower tire grooves, a typical cause of slip- ping on a wet road. These inspections are thus helping to prevent accidents induced by bad
tires. As we strive to meet customer expectations, we will continue to call public attention to the importance of tire inspections, thereby contributing to the creation of a safer mobility society.

 Promoting Social Contribution Activities: CSR Fund
In fiscal 2009, the Company established the “Sumitomo Rubber Industries CSR Fund” to provide financial support for various activ- ities aimed at solving global environmental and social problems, activities primarily being carried out by NPOs in regions where we have bases. This is supported by a matching gift program in which we appeal for donations from among likeminded employees and donate an amount equivalent to that collected.
In fiscal 2020, the Fund donated a total of ¥13.14 million to 54 organizations consisting of 18 environmental advocates, three disaster aid groups, and 33 community builders. Recently, the number of employees coming forth to support this initiative has been increasing as their social contribution awareness grows stron- ger. Reflecting this, this Fund achieved record highs for the third consecutive year since 2018 in terms of the number of recipients and total donation amount.
In fiscal 2021, a total of ¥14.10 million will be donated to 57 organizations.

  Reasons for Adopting the Current Corporate Governance Structure
3. Corporate Ethics Committee 4 meetings in fiscal 2020
The committee identifies, analyzes and evaluates compliance risks throughout the Sumitomo Rubber Group, plans and conducts training, ascertains the cause of violations, proposes preventive measures and thoroughly disseminates information on that throughout the Group.
The committee is composed of the officer in charge of corporate ethics (officer in charge of human resources and general affairs), officer in charge of audits, officer in charge of legal affairs, Audit Department Manager, Human Resources & General Affairs Department Manager and Legal Department Manager, with the President serving as the committee chair. In addition, two Standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members participate as observers. In fiscal 2020, the committee not only met four times but also held a corporate ethics lecture meeting to raise awareness of corporate ethics throughout the Group.
4. Audit & Supervisory Board 12 meetings in fiscal 2020
In accordance with audit plans and policies set out by the Audit & Supervisory Board, each Audit & Supervisory Board Member attends important meetings, including Board of Directors’ meetings; hears reports on the status of job execution from Directors and the internal audit office; reviews important approval documents; and implements on-site audits at the Head Office, major business sites and subsidiaries while working closely with the Accounting Auditor to ensure that audits are conducted in an appropriate manner.
The Audit & Supervisory Board consists of five members, of which two are selected as Standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members. In addition to attending important in-house meetings, the board confirms important documents for approval. From the aspect of reinforcing the management auditing function, three of the five Audit & Supervisory Board Members are Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, securing a structure to conduct fair and objective audits. The Audit & Supervisory Board meets once a month in general. In fiscal 2020, the

board met 12 times, and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members attended 100% of the Audit & Supervisory Board meetings.
5. Management Meeting 27 meetings in fiscal 2020
The Meeting makes prompt management decisions through discussions or the reporting of matters considered to be important to management.
The meeting consists of internal Directors, Standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members and Executive Officers appointed by the President, and the officer in charge of corporate planning serves as the chair of the meeting. The Management Meeting was convened 27 times in fiscal 2020.
6. Risk Management Committee 2 meetings in fiscal 2020
The committee oversees the Group’s risk management activities and appropriately examines and confirms whether business risks and other risks have been recognized and discussed and whether the risk man- agement system is functioning effectively.
The committee consists of the officers responsible for administration; research, design, and development; production; and sales and each busi- ness department, with the President serving as the committee chair. The two Standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members attend as observers. The Risk Management Committee was convened twice in fiscal 2020.
7. Sustainability Promotion Committee
The Sustainability Promotion HQ, which was established in January 2021 to push ahead with the Company’s sustainability activities, is tasked with the planning and implementation of relevant measures from a long-term perspective. With staff at this division acting as key members, the Sustainability Promotion Committee is engaged in delib- erations aimed at facilitating Companywide initiatives to address ESG issues and contribute to realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
 The Sumitomo Rubber Group is endeavoring to secure overall manage- ment efficiency while strengthening the relationship of trust between the Group and society and improving its operations in terms of fairness and transparency. To this end, we consider the audit functions the Audit & Supervisory Board and its members currently provide to be a matter of critical importance. Accordingly, the Group adopted a Company with an Audit & Supervisory Board system.
As part of its efforts to enhance corporate governance, since 2016 the Group has voluntarily maintained the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, an advisory body to the Board of Directors. The majority of
committee membership is accounted for by independent officers, with an Independent Outside Director acting as the committee chair. This committee is tasked with improving the objectivity and transparency of officer candidate selection and other key procedures. Moreover, the Company has appointed four Independent Outside Directors and issues questionnaires targeting Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. In these and other ways, we implement necessary measures to develop an even more robust discussion platform for the Board of Directors and enhance the effectiveness of its operations.

 Initiatives to Enhance the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors’ Operations
Remuneration of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
1. Matters Related to Remuneration and the Company’s Policies for Determining Its Calculation Method
   The Board of Directors’ Operations
To ensure that agenda items submitted to the Board of Directors are fully examined and discussed, we provide Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members with materials describing these items and presentations prior to each meeting. With regard to decision making on management matters of partic- ular importance, Executive Officers in charge of such matters occa- sionally provide prior briefings to these individuals.
Main topics of discussion at Board of Directors meetings in 2020 (agenda items)
newly appointed as Outside Directors with briefings that cover such topics as the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s latest business outline, its most recent operating results, challenges it is currently facing and other essential matters they need to know in light of their directorial duty to present advice on enhancing the Company’s standing.
Since 2016, Sumitomo Rubber Industries has conducted regular survey questionnaires for all Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members regarding various aspects of the Board of Directors, including its composition and operation. Based on the results of the survey, the Board of Directors then conducts deliber- ations aimed at increasing its effectiveness.
In fiscal 2020, the survey was conducted between September and October, and discussions were held in January 2021. The results confirmed the overall effectiveness of various aspects of the Board of Directors, including the number of Directors and mem- ber composition, operation of the board (frequency of meetings, discussion time, etc.), manner of deliberation, and monitoring of business execution, etc.
In addition, it was confirmed that our initiatives aimed at pro- viding fuller information to Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members helped invigorate discussion at Board of Directors’ meetings.
We will work on maintaining the Board of Directors’ environment and, as necessary, execute measures to enhance its effectiveness.
Remuneration and the Company’s Policies for Determining Its Calculation Method
With regard to the remuneration of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, the Company’s basic policy is to adopt a remuneration system that is linked to the interests of shareholders, so that it effectively functions as an incentive package rewarding members for their efforts to sustainably enhance corporate value. The Company also ensures that the remuneration of individual recipients is set at an appropriate level in light of their respective responsibilities.
Details of the methods for determining remuneration are as described below.
1Except for Outside Directors, remuneration for Directors and Executive Officers consists of a basic salary constituting a fixed por- tion and bonuses constituting a performance-based portion.
2Basic salary is a fixed amount paid monthly and is determined based on each recipient’s position, responsibilities and years in office and in accordance with basic salary tables determined after compre- hensively taking into consideration the level of remuneration at peer companies, the business performance of the Company, salary levels for employees and other factors.
3To enhance recipients’ awareness of their duty to improve business performance each business year, performance-based remuneration is paid in cash in a way that reflects performance indicators. An amount corresponding to the degree to which performance indicators have been met is paid at a predetermined time each year.
4Remuneration for Directors and Executive Officers is discussed based on objective and fair perspectives by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which is attended by independent officers, who make up the majority of committee membership, and chaired by an Independent Outside Director. Remuneration is thus determined in a way that takes into consideration recommendations from and con- clusions reached by the committee.
In addition, the level of remuneration is objectively adjusted by apply- ing findings from third-party surveys on remuneration paid at other companies.
Indicators Used for Determining Performance-Based Remuneration, Reasons for Adopting Such Indicators and Methods of Calculating Said Remuneration
When determining the amount of performance-based remuneration, the Company selects business profit, profit attributable to owners of the par- ent company and other performance indicators considered particularly important in light of its corporate strategy. The target values for these indicators are determined when midterm plans are formulated in a way that is consistent with said plans and revised as necessary in accordance
with changes in the environment, taking into consideration any recom- mendations from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
When determining the allocation of remuneration to each individual, the individual’s position, operational duties, level of responsibility, level of achievement of key targets within departments under his or her supervi- sion, level of contribution to business performance and other factors are taken into account from a medium- to long-term perspective. Proportional Composition of Remuneration for Directors (Except Outside Directors) by Type
The composition of each type of remuneration is engineered to ensure that the weighting of performance-based remuneration is higher for individuals in higher positions than it is for those in lower positions. This determination is benchmarked against the remuneration levels of com- panies of a similar business scale to the Company or in a related indus- try or with a similar business format. This composition is also discussed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.
The Representative Director and President, to whom the Board of Directors has delegated authority over the matter, determines the details of remuneration for individual recipients in a manner that honors recommendations from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and within the scope of the proportional composition set forth in such recommendations for each type of remuneration.
Furthermore, as a general rule regarding the proportional composition of each type of remuneration, the ratio of fixed remuneration (basic sal- ary) to performance-based remuneration (bonuses) is 7:3 for Directors, excluding Outside Directors, and 8:2 for Executive Officers, provided that the level of achievement of performance indicators is 100%.
   Training for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
The Company helps internal Directors and Executive Officers partic- ipate in external executive training at its own expense. By doing so, we ensure that these individuals are fully equipped with the knowl- edge necessary to serve as members of a key decision-making body of a listed company. Furthermore, we provide individuals who are

Raising the monetary criteria for tabling an item at a Board of Directors meeting
P Monetary limit for tabling an item at a Board of Directors meeting was raised in order to discontinue the tabling of insignificant items, thereby freeing that time to be used to discuss more strategic and important issues.
Earlier provision of materials
P Revised certain operating rules so as to enable materials provided in advance to be sent out earlier.
More complete information to be provided to outside officers in advance
P Hitherto, regular “Management Meeting Reports” and “Executive Officer Reports” had been presented to the Audit & Supervisory Board Members, in a different setting to that of the Board of Directors, and Outside Directors were added to this arrangement.
P Regular new reports to the Board of Directors also began in relation to the status of the Corporate Ethics Committee and the Risk Management Committee.
Further steps to provide more complete information to outside officers in advance
P Hitherto, explanations of the content of discussions at the Management Meeting related to agenda items at the Board of Directors had been sent in advance to outside officers, but we worked further to ensure that suf- ficient time is allowed and that more specific details are shared.
Improvements to the manner of reporting on business of which Executive Officers are in charge
P Hitherto, Executive Officers had presented regular reports on the business that they are in charge of at Board of Directors meetings, but we have revised the way reporting takes place, basing it on specific reporting themes in order to provide solid opportunities to exchange opinions.
Prior acceptance of questions with regard to agenda items and provision of answers
P The secretariat reaches out to individuals intending to attend an upcoming Board of Directors meeting and asks them whether they have questions and/or issues that need to be confirmed beforehand, with Executive Officers in charge of relevant operations providing them with necessary explanations at such opportunities as the Board of Directors meeting or prior briefings on agenda items.
Although the Company has not yet introduced stock-based remunera- tion designed to offer medium- to long-term incentives, the Company encourages officers to acquire shares of its stock through the officers’ stockholding association while giving due consideration to the status of achievements under its medium- to long-term management plans in the course of determining performance-based remuneration. As such, the Company strives to incentivize recipients to pursue sustainable growth for the Sumitomo Rubber Group.
With regard to stock-based remuneration, the Company will continue to engage in in-house discussion to assess the optimal timing for the introduction and determine the form and amount of such remuneration.

Information received by the Corporate Ethics Help Line shall be reported to the Corporate Ethics Committee, which, in turn, shall assess the situation and adopt the necessary measures. The Sumitomo Rubber Group’s Corporate Code of Conduct shall stipulate that any ties with antisocial forces must be severed, with the aim of securing a structure that refuses any requests from such forces.
5 A system regarding reporting on the execution of busi- ness by directors at subsidiaries to the Company
Each business division shall periodically receive reports from directors of each subsidiary under its supervision with regard to its performance targets and the achievement of such tar- gets. Pursuant to the Regulations Concerning Management of Subsidiaries, such division shall also receive reports from each

6 A system to ensure adequate financial reporting

Third-Party Remarks
Global Trend toward ESG Management
     Katsuhiko Kokubu
Professor at the Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University
Completed a doctoral program in business administration at Osaka City University Graduate School. After serv- ing as an assistant professor at Osaka City University and Kobe University, he assumed his current position in 2001. Head of the Graduate School of Business Administration at Kobe University from 2014 to 2016. Has served concurrent- ly as Vice President of Kobe University (from 2019 to 2021) and as Head of Kobe University V. School (since 2020). His recent publications include “From Accountability to Management Ethics” (Yuhikaku Publishing Co., Ltd.), “Emergent-Type Responsibility Management” (Nikkei Publishing Inc.) and “The 1st Step to Management Accounting” (Sekigakusha Inc.).
Over the last few years, we have seen a growing global trend toward ESG management. Previously, there had been quite a few companies publicizing ambitious statements regarding sustainability, but they have often failed to live up to these lofty goals in reality. However, today’s businesses are becoming ever more serious about practicing ESG management and taking con- crete action. Although Sumitomo Rubber Industries has been exemplary in terms of sustainability, I believe that the time has come for the Company to review its management approach to ESG issues on an across-the-board basis.
My Impression of the “Our Philosophy” Corporate Philosophy Framework
Viewed in this light, the establishment of “Our Philosophy” in fiscal 2020 is of great significance. With the Group’s Purpose serving as its pinnacle concept and defined as “Through innovation we will create a future of joy and well-being for all,” this Philosophy consists of a Story, a Vision and the SRI Way. Moreover, the “Governance” section of this report clarifies that “Our Philosophy” is intended to serve as the basis for all decision-making and as the impetus for all actions through- out the Group. Thus, the Group’s commitment to living up to this Philosophy is sure to be clearly understood by readers. Going forward, I would very much like to see the Group provide follow-up reports regarding changes in employee behavior driven by “Our Philosophy” from the next edition of its Integrated Report onward.
Improving Organizational Framework and Enhancing Human Capital
For a business that is actively pursuing sustainability, among its various responsibilities to stake- holders, its responsibilities with respect to its employees are of particular importance. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, corporations’ treatment of their employees is becoming a subject of general public concern. In this report, Sumitomo Rubber Industries presents a policy of promoting Work Style Reform as part of efforts aiming to improve its overall organizational framework. Looking ahead, I expect the Group to report further on the details of these endeavors in the section dedi- cated to human capital. When it comes to developing human capital, ensuring robust investment and resource allocation with respect to employees is a matter of the utmost importance. Today, a growing number of businesses worldwide share a common understanding that employees deserve a robust allocation of resources, such as investment in their education, because helping employees to enhance their skills and living standards is considered a part of a company’s corporate social responsibilities. In line with the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s corporate philosophy, I hope that a con- cept of this kind will serve as the cornerstone of the Group’s ESG management. This will, I believe, encourage all employees to substantially raise their awareness of ESG management and ultimately lead to the strengthening of the Group’s overall organizational capabilities.
Initiatives toward Carbon Neutrality
Sumitomo Rubber Industries has declared that it will strive to achieve carbon neutrality and is thus aiming to reduce net CO2 emissions from its factories to zero by 2050. Although its GHG reduction efforts with an eye toward 2050 are worthy of praise, I am somewhat concerned about the level of detail when it comes to breaking this target down into specific steps and milestones, as 2050 is still a long way off. I believe that the Company should pay particular attention to the perception of this issue among younger employees. As these individuals are highly likely to still be Sumitomo Rubber Group employees in 2050, their perceptions will be a key factor affecting the success of the aforementioned declaration.

Response to Third-Party Comments
I would once again like to thank Professor Kokubu for providing us with his pertinent advice and generous assessments. In line with the Midterm Plan that we announced in February 2020, our group has defined three key Value Drivers to propel our ongoing efforts to enhance both our economic value and our value to society, namely: “Developing & Promoting Sales of Advanced Products,” “Creating New Value,” and “Promoting ESG Management.” In the interests
of further promoting ESG Management, we newly established a Sustainability Promotion HQ in January 2021.
With a new corporate philosophy structure, “Our Philosophy,” now serving as the basis for all of our decisions and as the impetus behind all of our actions, we are committed to fostering organic changes in employee behavior (which is something that Professor Kokubu mentioned) and promoting Work Style Reform while simultaneously implementing various measures to achieve carbon neutrality and otherwise ensure that our business operations are as environmentally friendly as possible. Toward this end, all Group employees will come together in a united effort to push ahead with these ongoing endeavors. In this way, the Sumitomo Rubber Group will rally our combined strength in working to contribute
to the creation of a safe and sustainable society in which everyone can work and live with consistent peace of mind.

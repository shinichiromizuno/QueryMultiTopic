To implement global management in all of its corporate activities including the creation of a low-carbon society, in December 2010, the Group obtained ISO 14001 Global Multi-Site Certification for its 30 bases in Japan and overseas. This enabled us to carry out unified environmental management at major production and devel- opment bases in Japan and overseas.
At the end of 2020, the number of employees working at ISO 14001 Certified Sites as a percentage of total employees was 79.3%, and the ratio of Certified Sites was 94.7%.
In fiscal 2020, the Slovenia Factory obtained ISO 14001 certifi- cation on a stand-alone basis. Looking ahead, we will continue to work on activities aimed at adding the Switzerland Factory, which has already been certified on a stand-alone basis, and the above Slovenia Factory, to the Global Multi-Site Certification, and on new certification for the Philippines Factory.

Initiatives to Address Climate Change
We recognize that addressing risks and opportunities arising from climate change is an important management issue. In line with this recognition, we aim to appropriately implement mitiga- tion and adaptation measures and, to this end, have established the Sustainability Promotion Division in addition to launching the Sustainability Promotion Committee chaired by the President and tasked with comprehensively overseeing relevant initiatives carried out by all departments. As part of these efforts, preparations are now under way to publicly announce our support of the TCFD*1 recommendations and clarify our commitment to STB.*2

CO2 Emissions Reduction Activities in Production Bases
In fiscal 2020, we had to temporarily suspend operations at some factories due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we were thus unable to sufficiently implement energy-saving activities, we strove to launch new energy-saving measures by putting into practice insights offered by consultants in fiscal 2019. As a result, CO2 emis- sions from production activities at the Group’s factories in Japan decreased by 6 kt-CO2 to 265 kt-CO2 from the previous fiscal year.
However, the environmental impact indicator of CO2 emissions showed an 18.9% increase from the previous fiscal year.
In fiscal 2021, the Company will work on the predictive mainte- nance of facilities and on reducing CO2 through such initiatives as deploying AI and IoT platforms to search for, extract, and analyze factors that affect energy savings.

There are strong demands that global companies implement uni- form environmental management throughout the world regardless of country or region.
As it accelerates its global expansion, the Sumitomo Rubber Group is focusing ever more energy on promoting global environ- mental management.
The Sumitomo Rubber Group established its Environmental Policy in July 2007 and revised said policy in April 2019, putting it into practice via environmental initiatives.
49 Integrated Report 2021
In order to strengthen global environmental management, the Global Environmental Management Central Committee, which is composed primarily of responsible parties at bases in Japan and overseas and individuals responsible for issue-specific working groups, meets twice a year.
In 2020, the committee met in February and July. At these meetings, there were reports by representatives from domestic and overseas manufacturing factories on a wide range of activities, including actual results and improvements in various indicators such as CO2 emissions, energy savings, waste disposal and water usage, as well as efforts to improve the environment (odors, etc.) and contribution to society. Also, the Hybrid Rubber Products Division reported on its environmental initiatives, while CSR-related departments reported on their efforts to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) via the promotion of ESG-oriented management. Thus, attendees at both meetings engaged in active discussion on these matters.
In 2021, the committee was renamed the Sustainability Promotion Committee to indicate a shift to stronger focus on ESG-oriented man- agement. The committee will engage in the follow-up monitoring of initiatives aimed at addressing priority

Sustainability Activities Undertaken by the Sumitomo Rubber Group   Environmental: Our Environmental Initiatives CO2 Emissions Reduction in Logistics
In fiscal 2020, we worked to increase the modal shift rate by raising the precision of demand forecasts and ensuring scheduled ship- ments for marine and train transportation.
CO2 emissions from transporting tires fell 16.6% compared to the previous fiscal year, to 24.1 kt-CO2, and the environmental impact indicator fell 3.3%.
In fiscal 2021, we will work on optimizing the location of our production sites and reducing the number of products transported from one warehouse to another.
Building a Recycling-Oriented Society

Continue to Achieve Complete Zero Landfill Waste
The Sumitomo Rubber Group is promoting the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) of waste management in order to build a recycling- oriented society.
In fiscal 2020, we achieved complete zero landfill waste for the 11th consecutive year at our major production bases both in Japan and overseas.
Complete zero landfill waste is defined as the complete diversion of landfill waste, meaning a 100% recycling rate and no waste sent directly to landfills.
In fiscal 2021, the aim of our efforts is to proceed with our mis- sion to achieve zero emissions.

recycling of wastewater has also been implemented at the Thailand Factory and the Kakogawa Factory, while the Brazil Factory and the South Africa Factory initiated the recycling of factory wastewater. Furthermore, the Indonesia Factory is moving ahead with the use of rainwater to reduce external water usage.
In 2020, total water usage at all of the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s factories was reduced by about 8.5% year on year. We will push for- ward with water usage optimization in production processes at each base and measures that utilize the results of assessments based on the WRI* Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas on an ongoing basis.

   Efforts to Reduce Organic Solvents Use
The Group has been making voluntary efforts to reduce emissions of VOCs (volatile organic compounds). In fiscal 2020, there was a decrease in the total amount of VOCs emitted due to a significant cut in production volume. On the other hand, the environmental impact indicator deteriorated substantially.
In fiscal 2021, we will strive to achieve further reduction in the quantities of VOCs used while implementing measures to curb the evaporation of these substances.

Reducing Waste Disposal*
In fiscal 2020, the Group made efforts to curb waste disposal, for example by reducing metal scrap. However, the environmental impact indicator deteriorated, reflecting the cut in production volume. * Waste disposal refers to the amount of waste diverted for the thermal/material cycle.
Water Usage Reduction
With the aim of dealing with the global shortage of water resourc- es, as a measure to reduce water usage, the Group aims to achieve a wastewater recycling rate of 100% at all 26 factories around the world by fiscal 2050. The Turkey Factory is one of those within the Group with a higher level of water stress, and has been working on trial operations to establish water-recycling technology since 2018. In the summer of 2019, it achieved 100% recycling for factory wastewater by using concentrated water from the recycling facilities to water trees on the site of the factory and to flush toilets. In accordance with the Midterm Plan, the Group is aiming to establish water-recycling technology for 100% of the wastewater from a second factory in 2021, namely the Changshu Factory in China, which also has a high level of water stress.

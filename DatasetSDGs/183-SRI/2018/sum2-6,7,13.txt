CO2 Emissions Reduction Activities in Production
Bases
In fiscal 2017, the Group worked on waste heat recovery and other measures in order to reduce CO2 emissions in production activities. However, CO2 emissions in production activities of the Group’s factories in Japan increased by 4,000
tons-CO2 to 248,000 tons-CO2 from the previous fiscal year. The environmental impact indicator of CO2 emissions worsened 0.9% over the previous fiscal year. This was because of the impact

In fiscal 2017, we worked on optimizing the location of our production sites (loading at the closest port and production at a factory near the warehouse of the destination).These initiatives resulted in a drop in CO2 emissions from transporting tires to 28,300 tons-CO2, down 7.7% compared to the previous fiscal year. The Group has achieved 10.1% reduction of the environmental impact indicator.
We continue to shorten transport distances and increase modal shift rate in fiscal 2018.

  Building a Recycling-Oriented Society
Continue to Achieve Complete Zero Landfill
Waste
The Sumitomo Rubber Group is working to reduce, reuse and recycle wastes in order to build a recycling-oriented society.
Complete zero landfill waste is defined as complete diversion of landfill waste, with 100% recycling rate and no waste sent directly to landfills.
We achieved complete zero landfill waste at the Turkey Factory in fiscal 2017.
Reducing Waste Disposal*
We have conducted examinations and other initiatives on new suppliers with the aim of reducing waste disposal. In fiscal 2017, the environmental impact indicator at factories in Japan decreased by 4.0% as compared with the previous fiscal year.
The environmental impact indicator decreased by 13.6% at overseas factories, while decreasing by 17.7% at factories operated by domestic affiliates.
* Waste disposal refers to the amount of waste diverted for thermal/material recycling.
Waste Disposal (Excluding Valuables) (Factories in Japan)
Water Usage Reduction
With the aim of dealing with the global water resource shortage, the Group aims to achieve a wastewater recycling rate of 100% at each factory around the world by 2050. The Thailand Factory is proactively pushing forward with wastewater recycling; it has installed wastewater recycling equipment in the Factory 1 in fiscal 2016 and is planning to implement the same equipment in the Factory 2 in fiscal 2018. The Kakogawa Factory is using recycling equipment for a portion of wastewater and reduced its environmental impact indicator by approximately 19% year on year in December 2017.
The medium-term management plan sets a target of achieving a 100% wastewater recycling rate at two factories by fiscal 2020. The Turkey Factory plans to implement commissioning for establishing recycling technologies in fiscal
2018.In addition, the Group is pursuing reduction of water usage by effectively using rainwater, and in this context, rainwater usage was expanded at the Indonesia Factory in fiscal 2017.
The Group will push forward with water usage optimization in production processes at each base and measures that utilize results of the WBCSD*1 Global Water Tool and WRI*2 Aqueduct water risk assessments on an ongoing basis.

Implementing Global Environmental Management
Enlightening Activities for Environment at Each
Factory
The Group conducts environmental education so that all employees increase their awareness and knowledge about environmental issues and proactively participate in environmental preservation activities.
In fiscal 2017, we conducted activities for communicating information and knowledge on environment- related matters, including holding an “energy-saving assembly” for all employees at the Miyazaki Factory as a new initiative and airing of “environmental voices” public address program at the Zhongshan Factory in China.
These activities will be continued and complemented by other new approaches.
ISO 14001 Global Multi-Site Certification
To implement global management in all of its corporate activities including creation of a low-carbon society, in December 2010, the Group obtained ISO 14001 Global Multi-Site Certification for its 30 bases in Japan and overseas. This enabled us to carry out unified environmental management at major production and development bases in Japan and overseas.
In fiscal 2017, the Turkey Factory obtained the Global Multi-Site Certification and the number of certified factories increased to 32.
In fiscal 2018, the activities will be continued within two factories (South Africa and USA) that have already received individual certification to obtain the Global Multi-Site Certification.
 In fiscal 2018, we are aiming to ensure that this
continues at existing sites. 12

Reduction of Water Usage by Introduction of Wastewater Recycling Equipment
At the Thailand Factory, various initiatives for reducing water usage were implemented but the improvement was limited. Wastewater recycling equipment was introduced as the water utility charge increases drove up manufacturing costs. The water usage has been significantly reduced and water utility charges and costs for recycling waste water have also been saved, as we can recycle wastewater on site.In addition, water pollution risk by wastewater is mitigated, and we plan to introduce the same equipment in Factory 2 as well.
Going forward, we aim to be a factory that contributes to environmental preservation in the region by discharging no wastewater.

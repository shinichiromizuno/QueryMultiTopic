 The Sumitomo Rubber Group and The SRI Way
As a promising and reliable global com contributions to improving both comm
The Sumitomo Rubber Group upholds “The SRI Way” in order to implement the corporate philosophy.
“The SRI Way” consists of “Values” and “Action Principles” for all of our employees to realize the “corporate philosophy” and the “management vision” in their day-to-day work, and the “Sumitomo Business Spirit.” “Values” indicate four values, namely, “Integrity and Soundness,” “Communication,” “Set the Bar Higher” and “Cultivate People” in line with the Company’s theme of “What do we consider important?”
“Action Principles” based on these values clearly define “How should we act?”
All of this is based on the “Sumitomo Business Spirit” continuously handed down over 400 years of Sumitomo history.
Origin of the Sumitomo Business Spirit
Masatomo Sumitomo, founding father of the Sumitomo family, left a letter titled “Monjuin Shiigaki” to explain the principles of doing business. His teachings have been passed down over 400 years as the business spirit of Sumitomo, passing through the latter-day “Business Principles,” and have supported management of the Sumitomo Group.
The “Sumitomo Business Spirit” reflects Sumitomo’s strong sense of mission and commitment to improving society: “our business is not only for the benefit of Sumitomo, but for the benefit of the nation and society as well,” and serves as the foundation for the Corporate Philosophy of the Sumitomo Rubber Group.

     Our Top Commitment
 Creating Both Economic Value &
The pursuit of societal value, like the pursuit of economic value, is absolutely essential for a company to achieve sustained growth. As a core element of Sumitomo’s business philosophy, this is an idea that has been passed down from generation to generation throughout Sumitomo’s 400-year history.
By continually providing “The World’s Best Value” for all of our Stakeholders, the Sumitomo Rubber Group always aims to be a corporate group that achieves sustained growth while at the same time contributing to the development of a sustainable society.
Announcing a Visionary New Technological Development Concept & Expanding Our Sports Business
In our Tire Business, the Sumitomo Rubber Group has long been actively engaged in developing and expanding sales of environmentally friendly tires. Then, in 2017, we unveiled our “SMART TYRE CONCEPT(*),” a new technology development concept that aims to develop truly groundbreaking tires that will achieve a whole new level of Environmental Performance and Safety Performance. Our Tire Business will continue working to bring our SMART TYRE CONCEPT to fruition as soon as possible so that we may further enhance our value to society, while at the same time developing new products with high added value for speedy delivery to market.
In other news, the Sumitomo Rubber Group acquired the trademark rights to the DUNLOP brand from Sports Direct International in 2017, alongside the company’s sporting goods business and licensing business. Following this move, our Group integrated DUNLOP Sports into Sumitomo Rubber Industries at the beginning of 2018. Moving forward, we will take full advantage of the corporate resources of Sumitomo Rubber Industries (including our strong financials and cutting-edge materials development and R&D capabilities) and DUNLOP Sports (including talented staff who are well versed in the sporting goods industry) as we work to enhance the value of the DUNLOP brand while expanding our Sports Business. In addition, with the recent implementation of our Trilateral Global Management System, we will work to further strengthen our global organizational capabilities to facilitate the growth and development of the Sumitomo Rubber Group over the mid- to-long term.
(*) Please refer to Page 47 for further details of our SMART TYRE CONCEPT.
Strengthening Our Global Management System toward the Accomplishment of Our Long-Term Vision—VISION 2020
VISION 2020 is the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s Long-Term Vision, reflecting our basic corporate stance as we simultaneously pursue both economic and societal value under our stated goals of “Becoming a True Global Player with High Profits and Rapid Growth” and “Pursuing Enhanced Value for All Stakeholders and Greater Happiness for All Employees.” Toward the accomplishment of these goals, we have chosen “Go for NEXT” as our rallying slogan for VISION 2020 in the hope that it will unite all of our employees with a strong, shared desire to contribute to society for future generations by actively taking on New Challenges. In addition to this slogan, we have also defined three key Growth Engines as pillars to support our overall efforts to take on various New Challenges: the “Challenges of New Markets,” an “Insatiable Drive for Innovation” and “Entering New Business Fields.”
As part of our efforts to take on the “Challenges of New Markets,” we are pushing forward with rapid business expansion in developing countries and other growth markets while also striving to promote harmonious coexistence with local communities through expanded local recruiting to create jobs and contribute to regional development, reducing the environmental impact of our operations and so forth.
Embracing Our “Insatiable Drive for Innovation” to Provide New Value in Terms of Safety, Comfort & the Environment
In keeping with our “Insatiable Drive for Innovation,” we have been actively engaged in research and development activities that aim to answer the key question: “What can tires contribute to the global environment?” with a focus on three key areas of environmentally friendly product development—Fuel Efficiency, Raw Materials and Resource Savings. In 2020, our Group plans to begin mass production of a new tire that incorporates Performance Sustaining Technology to maintain the
Societal Value
performance of a tire like brand new for longer. That same year, we also plan to unveil a concept tire that incorporates LCA (Life Cycle Assessment), adopting new materials designed to enhance environmental performance throughout the entire lifecycle of a tire—from raw materials and tire production to shipping, usage and even recycling. Then, in 2023, we plan to unveil a new concept tire that incorporates our proprietary Active Tread Technology, which allows a tire tread to adapt to road conditions for optimized performance in any environment. The Sumitomo Rubber Group will continue these and other research and development efforts towards accomplishing our goal of completing an all-new type of tire that incorporates all of our SMART TYRE CONCEPT technologies by the end of the next decade so that we may provide even more new value in terms of Safety, Comfort and the Environment.
When it comes to “Entering New Business Fields,” we are focusing our efforts on expanding our Healthcare Business. In particular, having acquired a Swiss manufacturer of medical rubber parts in January of 2015, we are now taking advantage of the High Quality and High Performance that we have cultivated in the Japanese market to deliver safety and peace of mind to medical and caregiving facilities throughout the world.
Striving to Be a Truly Valuable Company with a Strong Sense of Purpose
The Sumitomo Rubber Group will continue to harness these three Growth Engines to tackle the challenges of societal problems toward achieving sure and sustainable growth. With the aim of fully meeting the expectations of all of our Stakeholders, we established the SRI WAY in order to clearly define the specific Values and Action Principles that we hope all of our employees will practice and exemplify as they go about their day-to-day work. Toward this same aim, we also strive to engender a corporate culture in which all employees feel a strong sense of purpose while creating workplaces with a free and open atmosphere, where employees can encourage one another to do their best and set the bar higher together.
With the recent rise of ESG investment, which emphasizes the importance of non-financial factors (i.e. Environmental, Social, Governance), it is safe to say that the ideals of SDGs (Social Development Goals) are beginning to take root. Guided by our Basic CSR Philosophy and our CSR Guidelines as encompassed in the acronym “GENKI,” as well as our CSR Message—“For You, For the Earth”—the Sumitomo Rubber Group is not only working to fulfill our various social responsibilities in terms of compliance and environmental preservation, but are also actively applying our advanced technology and research and development capabilities toward solving societal problems and contributing to global progress with an eye toward future generations.
On behalf of the Sumitomo Rubber Group, I sincerely hope for and look forward to the continued guidance and support of all Stakeholders. In addition, I wish to say that we would very much appreciate your candid thoughts and opinions with regard to this year’s Group Report.

 Special Feature 1 Insatiable Drive for Innovation Endless Drive for Innovation
— Challenges of the Tire Business to Meet the Needs of Society
Establishing New Technologies to Contribute to a Future Mobility Society
The automobile industry is now facing a centennial change with the emergence of new technologies such as automated driving and electric motorization. New, ever-higher technologies are demanded of tires, including quietness during driving, wear resistance performance that accommodates with vehicle weight that is increasing due to the effect from installation of electrical equipment and introduction of intelligent technologies including mounting of sensors to regularly provide drivers with aging deterioration information. With an eye on these changes in the environment, the Group is committed to achieving “even greater safety” and “even higher environmental performance” through the new technology development concept “SMART TYRE CONCEPT” and thereby contributes to a future mobility society.
Challenges of New Materials That Pave the Way for Future
The Group has promoted development of a technology that enables long-sustained performance of tires equivalent to brand-new ones. With “ENASAVE NEXT II,” which was awarded the Grand Prize in 2017 Nikkei Global Environmental Technology Awards, the Group succeeded in developing whole new rubber by clearly and successively analyzing and simulating the inner structure of rubber, from the nano to micron levels, using the proprietary new material development technology “ADVANCED 4D NANO DESIGN” and utilizing alliance with cutting-edge large-scale research facilities at the world's highest levels. This tire boasts the highest level of fuel efficiency in the history of Dunlop wherein the “wear resistance performance” has been exponentially improved and the three key contradictory performance traits of tires are simultaneously enhanced at the high level.
Development Addressing Needs of Each Region of the World
Performance requirements on which emphasis is placed for automobiles and tires may differ worldwide depending on road circumstances, laws and regulations, culture, etc. While fuel efficiency performance, driving comfort, quietness and other feels of comfort are deemed more important in the Japanese market, the European market places more importance on stability and safety during driving at high speeds. Furthermore, performance requirements differ in each region of the emerging regions such as Asia, Africa and South America. The Group will work to commercialize products that proactively incorporate requirements demanded by each region and launch new products that surpass the expectations of our customers.
Demand for automobiles is increasing globally, and the environment surrounding the industry is now in the midst of tremendous change.
While new manufacturers have emerged and the competition has become even more intensified in the tire industry, one of our biggest challenges is how to deal with environmental issues.
The Sumitomo Rubber Group is pushing forward with the Insatiable Drive for Innovation under the three themes of “safety,” “comfort” and the “environment” in tires that are
said to have a significant impact on performance among the automotive parts.

     ENASAVE NEXT II
   Introducing A New Technology Development
Concept “SMART TYRE CONCEPT”
With an eye on changes in the external environment, Sumitomo Rubber Industries has created a new technology development concept “SMART TYRE CONCEPT” for the development of new tires which are set apart from the conventional ones and achieve “even greater safety” and “even higher environmental performance.”
The Group pushes forward with technology development with the aim of releasing new products in a stepwise manner and completing a whole new tire that uses all technologies under the “SMART TYRE CONCEPT” in late 2020s.
Five Core Areas in the “SMART TYRE CONCEPT”

      Special Feature 1 Insatiable Drive for Innovation — Challenges of the Tire Business to Meet Frontier Spirit of Engineers
Handed Down Over the Times
-Pursuing Comfort That People Can Directly Experience-
the Needs of Society
DUNLOP’s flagship product “DUNLOP/LE MANS” has been popular with its sporty, light and crisp driving since its launch in 1982.
Mainly the young engineers in their 20s conducted a fundamental review on the basic design concept,
got through numerous obstacles and overturned conventional industry wisdom to create this comfort tire.
The designer of the 15th-generation “LE MANS V” explains the journey that the development project had traveled.
Special Feature 1 Insatiable Drive for Innovation
 Start! Listen to Users’ Voices and Needs
To start with, the development project team collected information by
visiting the tire distributors throughout Japan and analyzed such information repeatedly. The results indicated that the vast majority of users seek “comfort and quietness and fuel efficiency” in tires. This led to the formulation of a new concept of “tires with significantly improved comfort and quietness, while sporty elements are maintained.” Our development activities have started in pursuit of comfort that people can directly experience.

Step3
The Members All Pursued the Invariable Goal
In the final phase of the development activities, the development
and dampening of shocks from the road surface by rounding the shape of the cross section of tires so that tire vibrations are suppressed. I also developed a pattern wherein the shape of groove on tread surfaces is thoughtfully designed so that both flexibility in the vertical direction to follow the bumpiness of the road surface and rigidity in the horizontal direction to fully accommodate with turn of the steering wheel are achieved.
This new technology that suppresses tire vibrations occurred by shocks from the road surface was named the “SHINOBI TECHNOLOGY” and later introduced to the general users through a promotion video in which ninjas are appearing. In addition, I have made my commitment to the best in improving comfort by, for example, applying a fine protrusion finish in the groove, taking a hint from owl feather, as
a technology to reduce noises from tires.
project members created some prototypes of the new product based on the different specifications so as to conduct a final check on the performance of “LE MANS V” and tested them by actually driving on the highways between Okayama and Hakata, back and forth, with five cars and 15 drivers. After the test, finally, the members judged which prototype should be chosen to go for production. The answers of all 15 members were identical. All the project members headed in the same direction and consistently pursued the goal. This made it possible for them to reach the same conclusion.
Placed on the Market in February 2017, Awarded the “Good Goal! Design Award” in October 2017
Four years after the project commenced, “LE MANS V” was placed on the market in February 2017. The high level of comfort gained popularity and the product soon became one of the big-selling products.
In the recognition of the sophisticated design that shows the high level of comfort and other elements, the product was awarded the “Good Design Award 2017” in October 2017. Sumitomo Rubber Industries has established an organizational strength where even a project team consisting mainly of young engineers can earn achievements.

Constantly targeting new value creation, the Sumitomo Rubber Group engages proactively in research and development (R&D).
In addition to these efforts, the Group preserves the fruits of its research as intellectual property and has established structures to fully capitalize on its intellectual property rights.
Sports Business
R&D sections are put in place at both Dunlop Sports Co., Ltd. (merged with the Company by absorption on January 1, 2018) and Roger Cleveland Golf Company, Inc. in the U.S. and pursuing the development, evaluation and testing of new technologies and products, employing computer simulations and other technologies.
The “Golf Science Center” in Tamba, Hyogo comprehensively measures, analyzes and evaluates an extremely large volume of data, including profiles of golf clubs and balls and relationships between golf swing forms and clubs, collected by such means as tests using a swing machine and tests on various golfers ranging from top professional golfers to average golfers.
Utilizing these technologies, the 10th-generation “XXIO X” golf clubs were developed and released in December 2017.
As for golf balls, the NEW “SRIXON Z-STAR series” were released in February 2017.
R&D expenses in the Sports business totaled ¥1.5 billion.
Industrial and Other Products Business
We are actively developing new products aimed at accommodating consumer needs in such fields as vibration control units using high damping rubber, rubber parts for medical applications and precision rubber parts for office equipment.
In the field of vibration control units, the Company conducted in-house shake table experiments simulating real- life earthquake intensity in January 2017 and January 2018 to verify vibration control performance of “MIRAIE,” a vibration control unit for detached housing. As a result, the amplitude of the tremor was reduced by up to 95%*.
R&D expenses in the Industrial and Other Products business totaled ¥1.8 billion.
* The results are based on the in-house shake table experiments and the actual reduction rate will be dependent on the shape of buildings, layout plans and seismic waves.
Intellectual Property Strategies
Basic Policy
The Group proactively carries out intellectual property activities that support its businesses. The Group has set forth a basic policy with regard to such activities in accordance with “VISION 2020,” a long-term vision established in 2012.
Specifically, the Group undertakes intellectual property activities focusing on three pillars, namely: 1) “securing intellectual property rights” with regard to such industrial properties as patents, utility models, designs and trademarks; 2) “exercising such rights” against the infringement of Sumitomo Rubber Industries’ intellectual properties; and 3) “eliminating risk” by developing a structure to protect its rights from violation by third parties.
Current Status of Basic Policy Implementation
Thanks to the success of intellectual property training for employees and the introduction of a structure that connects technological development to patent application, the Group has successfully accumulated an even greater number of patents with significant business potential.
The Group seeks to effectively utilize the intellectual
property rights that it has acquired, defending such rights against infringement worldwide. For example, in Europe the Group diligently files litigation against infringement while in Asia it is strengthening cooperation with national administrative bodies to ensure that products that infringe on the Group’s rights, including imitations and copies, are seized by customs or, when possible, their production sites are identified and dealt with. To secure the competitive advantage of its products and earn greater trust, the Group will constantly reinforce the structure it has built to ensure the protection of its intellectual property rights against such infringement.
Responding to Globalization
In step with the rapid expansion of its overseas operations, the scope of the Group’s intellectual property activities is growing worldwide, encompassing not only Japan but also the U.S., Europe and such Asian countries as China as well as Russia and countries in South America, the Middle East and Africa.
Efforts are now under way to nurture human resources and reinforce our structure to conduct intellectual property activities that go along with such globalization. In particular, the Group is providing training sessions not only for Intellectual Property Department members but also for employees at every operational base with the aim of raising awareness of intellectual property and upgrading the competencies of the entire workforce. Such action is facilitating the development of a structure that ensures intellectual property activities are carried out smoothly and seamlessly on a Group-wide basis.
On the other hand, to reinforce the structure, it is essential to cooperate with such external organizations as legal firms, patent offices, patent agents, research agencies, administrative bodies and judicial organs in Japan and overseas. With the aim of strengthening the connections between the Group and these organizations as well as across- the-board communication, the Group formulates and implements projects that involve internal and external collaborations.
Moreover, the Group renewed its in-house Intellectual Property Management System while reorganizing its relevant departments, with the aim of improving operational efficiencies and ensuring that information is shared globally. Through the renewal and reorganization, the Group established a network that connects all of its operational bases and agencies around the world. These actions also facilitated a switchover from paper-based to paperless operations that utilize a workflow system and database, significantly accelerating the Group’s operations and enhancing the security.
Focusing on the abovementioned three pillars, the Group will promote the more efficient implementation of intellectual property activities encompassing all regions worldwide.

Meanwhile, a tire sensing technology “SENSING CORE” was introduced in May 2017, which detects slipperiness of the road surface and load on each tire of the four wheels and other data in real time. This technology applies technology, the “Deflation Warning System (DWS),” that detects a decrease in air pressure by analyzing wheel speed signals generated from the rotation of tires and is possible to make presumptions using software, without the need of any additional sensors. This technology contributes to safer driving, and the Company believes that it would also contribute to advancement of autonomous vehicles which are going to make rapid evolution going forward. In October 2017, the Company also released a new technology development concept “SMART TYRE CONCEPT” to develop tires delivering performance required by the future mobility society. This concept is comprised of three technologies: technology that supports safety including “SENSING CORE;” technology that contributes to environment; and simulation and analysis technology that supports the foregoing technologies. The Company aims to push forward with product development incorporating these technologies.

Tire Business
“What tire technology can do for the global environment”— Guided by this underlying concept, the Group’s R&D efforts to create environmentally friendly products focus on three areas: “innovative materials,” “fuel efficiency” and “resource conservation,” with the Tyre Technical Center, located near the Kobe Head Office, serving as the core facility and in collaboration with the European and United States Technical Centers which commenced full-scale operations in 2017.
Our accomplishments in tire development included the November 2016 release of the “ENASAVE NEXT II” long- lasting, fuel-efficient tire under the DUNLOP brand. The ENASAVE NEXT II is the first product that used “ADVANCED 4D NANO DESIGN” since the establishment of this new material development technology in 2015.

 Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance Structure
Overview
Sumitomo Rubber Industries has adopted a corporate system with an Audit & Supervisory Board and maintains Directors, a general meeting of shareholders, Accounting Auditors and the following bodies.
The Company’s Board of Directors deliberates and determines matters of managerial importance and supervises Directors’ execution of operations. As of March 30, 2018, the Board of Directors was composed of 11 members, 3 of whom were Outside Directors.
Audit & Supervisory Board Members independently conduct audit of Directors’ execution of operations. As of March 30, 2018, the Company adopted a structure of 5 Audit & Supervisory Board Members, 2 of whom were standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members. Standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members attend important internal meetings and confirm important documents for approval.
The Audit & Supervisory Board is composed of all of the Company’s Audit & Supervisory Board Members. From the aspect of reinforcing the management auditing function, 3 of the 5 Audit & Supervisory Board Members serve as Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, securing a structure to conduct fair and objective audits.
In addition to the abovementioned organizations stipulated under Japan’s Corporation Law, the Company established a Management Committee composed of internal Directors and executive officers appointed by the president. With the attendance of standing Audit & Supervisory Board Members, the Management Committee makes prompt managerial decisions based on discussions or the reporting of matters considered to be important to management.
Furthermore, the Company adopted an executive officer system in March 2003. This system was put in place with the aim of establishing a management structure that promotes the separation of management supervision and execution, clarifies the rights and responsibilities of each business and promptly responds to changes in the business environment. As of March 30, 2018, there were 31 executive officers, 23 of whom did not serve concurrently as Directors.
To realize even greater corporate value, in 2016 the Company established the “Nomination and Remuneration Committee” as a voluntary advisory body for the Board of Directors to ensure objective and transparent procedures for nominating officers and determining remuneration for officers. The Committee is chaired by an Independent Outside Director, and the majority of members are Independent Outside Officers.
Reasons for Adopting
the Aforementioned Structure
Guided by the “Sumitomo Business Spirit” as well as its “Corporate Philosophy,” the Sumitomo Rubber Industries maintains a basic management policy of sustainably enhancing its corporate value as a promising and reliable global company acting for the benefit of all stakeholders, including shareholders. To that end, Sumitomo Rubber Industries continually strives to deliver attractive offerings, greater user comfort and other value for consumers. Under this policy, the Group considers the enhancement of corporate governance a major management objective, as it aims to ensure Groupwide business efficiency, establish deep relationships of trust with society and maintain fair and even more transparent operations. Accordingly, the Group currently believes that the aforementioned corporate governance structure is best suited to facilitating these pursuits.
Implementation and
Status of the Internal Control System
Based on “compliance with social norms,” which is stipulated in the Company’s “Corporate Code of Conduct,” Sumitomo Rubber Industries maintains the guideline that “corporate activities must adhere to laws and ordinances, social norms and standards of public decency. Moreover, the Company has established “systems to ensure that in the execution of their duties, Directors comply with laws and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and that Group operations undertaken by the Company and its subsidiaries are always appropriate,” thereby securing strict legal compliance. In addition to complying with laws and its Articles of Incorporation, Sumitomo Rubber Industries aims to fulfill its corporate social responsibilities and, to this end, has established a strict code of corporate ethics while pursuing sound business operations. To that end, the Company formulated “Regulations on Corporate Ethics Activities” in February 2003. Simultaneously and in line with these regulations, the Company established the “Corporate Ethics Committee,” which meets on a quarterly basis and is chaired by the president, with the aim of strengthening its Group- wide compliance system. Furthermore, Sumitomo Rubber Industries set up a “Compliance Counseling Room” directly controlled by the president as a corporate ethics helpline for employees. This enables the “Corporate Ethics Committee” to investigate any problems that arise within the Group and give sufficient attention to ensuring that those employees who come forward are not penalized. With a close eye on
legal issues, the Company also takes such measures as seeking advice from corporate attorneys as circumstances demand.
Implementation and Status of the Risk Management System
With regard to a variety of management risks that could exert a significant impact on Group operations, including issues with product quality, legal requirements, environmental concerns, credit, accidents and disasters, each division and department undertakes preemptive analyses of potential risks and formulates appropriate countermeasures, which are discussed at management meetings in accordance with the “Regulations Concerning Risk Control.” When conducting risk analysis and formulating countermeasures, the Company requests on an as-needed basis advice and
instruction from specialists, such as corporate attorneys. For cross-departmental risks, each administration department works in close collaboration with related divisions and departments in their respective areas of operation to conduct Companywide countermeasures.
Furthermore, Sumitomo Rubber Industries established a “Risk Management Committee” based on its “Regulations Concerning Risk Control.” Chaired by the president, the Risk Management Committee meets twice a year to control Group-wide risk management activities and investigates such activities to confirm the effectiveness of the risk management system.
If any material risk becomes clear or could be anticipated, the president shall establish a Risk Management Center pursuant to the “Regulations Concerning Risk Control. ”
The Sumitomo Rubber Group’s basic management policy is to enhance its corporate value as a promising and reliable global company for the benefit of all stakeholders, including shareholders. Under this policy, the Group considers the enhancement of corporate governance as a major management objective in its efforts to better fulfill its social responsibility and enhance its transparency. This policy will help to strengthen Group management and establish deep relationships of trust with society, while ensuring Group-wide business efficiency.

  Message from Outside Director
Outside Director Kenji Murakami
This is the third year since my appointment as an Outside Director in 2016. In my view, Sumitomo Rubber Industries is a company where many employees retain a positive attitude and diligently work on their duties in an open corporate culture, allowing them to feel worthwhileness of work. I also think that the corporate culture is a significant strength, as it makes the Company possible to take on various challenges, with faithful manufacturing as its pivot, in the middle of drastic changes in the environment surrounding the automobile industry.
For the Company aiming to become a truly global
player, the immediate task is to further enhance value of the DUNLOP brand and quickly expand the scope of business in the tires, sports and other businesses.
I believe that, under such circumstances, my experience in which I seriously worked as a corporate manager to spread the “Daiwa House” brand will be useful here, at some points during the course of the challenge.
At the Board of Directors meetings, I always bear in mind that I should state my opinions from a broad perspective based on the belief that “management maintaining a balance between offense and defense” and the “sense of unity across the company” should be held as important particularly when efforts towards sustained growth are well underway.
I think that the governance system of the Company is excellent as it has, among others, a system to encourage the vitalization of activities of the Board of Directors by, for example, providing Outside Directors, including me, with internal information in advance and opportunities to talk with officers in charge of each business in person.
I am committed to contributing to the development of the Company from this point forward as well by providing advice drawing on my long years of experience as a corporate manager.
 Corporate Governance

In accordance with audit plans and policies set out by the Audit & Supervisory Board, each Audit & Supervisory Board Member attends important meetings, including Board of Directors’ meetings; hears reports on the status of job execution from Directors and internal audits; reviews important approval documents; and implements on-site audits at the Head Office, major business sites and subsidiaries while working closely with Accounting Auditors to ensure that audits are conducted in an appropriate manner.
Sumitomo Rubber Industries’ internal audit function is the responsibility of the Audit Department. Under the direct control of the president, the Audit Department is composed of 12 staff and one full-time assistant to the Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The Audit Department conducts audits of the Group as a whole and evaluates the effectiveness of its internal control system over the Group’s financial reporting. In accordance with audit policies and annual internal audit plans, the Audit Department implements onsite audits of the Head Office, major business sites and affiliates to evaluate the efficacy, efficiency and degree of compliance adequacy in connection with the execution of operations at each division and department and related Group company. On the completion of an internal audit, the results and any recommendations for improvement are reported to the president and the Audit & Supervisory Board in an effort to ensure reciprocal collaboration. The Audit Department and Accounting Auditors facilitate closer collaboration as needed to fulfill their duties.
For accounting audits, the Company has entered into an audit agreement with KPMG AZSA LLC in line with the Corporation and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Laws. In fiscal 2017, Mr. Kenichiro Kuroki, Mr. Hirofumi Tani and Mr. Takeru Yamada were primarily responsible for accounting audits as certified public accountants (CPAs), with 27 other CPAs serving as their assistants alongside 23 staff members at KPMG AZSA LLC.

Remuneration of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Remuneration Amount and the Company’s Policies for Determining Its Calculation Method

Since 1988, the Group has had in place the “GENKI Activities” project (meaning activities that give everybody energy), in which employees take part in volunteer and environmental conservation activities as a way to contribute to society.
These are the essence of our CSR activities, and have become firmly entrenched throughout the Company and Group. In 2008 GENKI was set as a keyword in our CSR Guidelines.

Identifying Materiality and Dialogue with Stakeholders
Taking into account international guidelines and stakeholders’ views, we determined the materiality of CSR-related activities (priority issues). We have prioritized the 19 indicators of the CSR guidelines, and will further work towards these initiatives.
Stakeholder Dialogues
We periodically carry out surveys to learn about the various opinions and expectations of stakeholders, and while taking their views into account, we also place importance on daily dialogue with stakeholders in pursuing our business activities.
How We Communicate with Stakeholders
We are conscious of our responsibilities towards stakeholders, and are working to promote communications through a variety of means.
Materiality Identification Process
To energize the CSR activities of the Sumitomo Rubber Group and become a corporate group trusted by society, in fiscal 2008 the Group formulated its Basic CSR Philosophy and its CSR Guidelines (five areas comprising 13 indicators) made up of the five areas of “Green (green initiatives),” “Ecology (reducing the environmental impact of business activities),” “Next (development of next-generation technologies and products),” “Kindness (kindness to employees)” and “Integrity (integrity for stakeholders).”
In fiscal 2011, we identified which of these 13 indicators in the
CSR Guidelines were the most important (their “materiality”).
In fiscal 2014, taking into account the impact on stakeholders and society due to changes in the business environment, we set 19 key
CSR indicators.
In fiscal 2015, we prioritized efforts for these 19 indicators,
taking into account required content in the “GRI Guidelines (G4)*” and based on a survey of various stakeholders.
This report presents the results of such efforts aimed at attaining each CSR target.

   TEAM ENASAVE Future Project, Protecting
Culture and Nature
With the goal of protecting
Japan’s vanishing cultural
assets and natural
environment, in fiscal 2013
the Group launched the
TEAM ENASAVE Future
Project in cooperation with the National Federation of UNESCO Associations in Japan (NFUAJ).
As a part of this project, in fiscal 2017 we held activities at seven locations around Japan, with the help of employees, their families, and local associations. Together with volunteers from the public as well as radio listeners, these events have seen 430 people participate in total.
Preservation and Nurturing of Endangered
Species
The Group has been engaged in preservation and nurturing of Sasakia charonda (the great purple emperor butterfly), one of the quasi-endangered species, at Ichijima Factory in Hyogo Prefecture as part of our activities to preserve and nurture endangered species. Meanwhile, there has been a sighting of Sasakia charonda flying in Okayama Tire Proving Ground. There are indigenous hackberries growing in the woods within the Tire Proving Ground (Sasakia charonda larvae feed on hackberry leaves)
  Management Approach
Progress of the One Million Trees for Local Forests Project
Forests absorb CO2 which contributes to global warming, and are an important social infrastructure for preserving biodiversity. Based on the thought that preserving this infrastructure is one of our corporate social responsibilities, we promote “Green (Green Initiative)” as one part of Sumitomo Rubber Group CSR Activity Guidelines through ongoing tree planting activities in and around our operation bases within Japan and overseas.
In fiscal 2009, we launched the “One Million Trees for Local Forests Project” to plant one million trees on and around our facilities around the world in 20 years. We have kept well ahead of our initial 20-year target, reaching a total of 1.717 million trees planted as of fiscal 2017. We will continue to plant trees as well as putting effort in forest maintenance.

  “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest,” a green
initiative in Japan
In addition to the grounds of our facilities, we engage in forestation activities in the surrounding area and at the 11 locations (23 ha) in Japan designated as “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest.”
When planting trees, one has to be aware of the negative effect non-native species can have on local ecosystem. As such we only plant seedlings grown using acorn seeds gathered in the target area. Our continued efforts are aimed at increasing the amount of greenery around us while protecting biodiversity
While the number of trees planted has been decreasing as the area available for planting is getting smaller, 1,511 acorn seedlings were planted in “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest” in fiscal 2017.
Maintenance work after tree planting is also important for forestation. Weed cutting, removal of vines, removal of unnecessary trees, pruning and thinning work are carried out.
In addition, 8,472 acorn seedlings were given away to organizations and
local residents who are engaged in the green initiative and so wish.
Pruning work in a “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest” in Sasayama City, Hyogo Prefecture
Volunteer activities carried out with local residents in a “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest” in Miyakonojo City, Miyazaki Prefecture
Collaborative activities with local residents and other parties in “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest”
The objectives of forestation activities include prevention of global warming by absorption of CO2, landslide prevention and biodiversity preservation, as well as to communicate with local communities through satoyama (border zone between unpopulated mountain foothills and populated flat land) conservation activities.
To achieve forest creation rooted in each community, we promote activities in which employees, former employees, families, friends, local residents and regional organizations participate.
Preserving Biodiversity
Creation of Regional Biotopes by Hand
The Group is carrying out creation of biotopes within its business bases so that a wide variety of organisms living in these areas may be able to build natural ecosystems unique to such areas. Five biotopes are now established in total: the Shirakawa Factory “Shirakawa no Izumi,” the Nagoya Factory “Koromo no Izumi,” the Kobe Head Office “Soso no Izumi,” the Miyazaki Factory “Kirishima no Izumi,” and the Ichijima Factory biotope.
The biotopes in those regions were created by the hands of employees on their days off. With the cooperation of local residents, we preserve, nurture and return endemic plants and aquatic life to local areas.
  Topics
Greening Activities Overseas “Team ENASAVE Green Project”
The “Team ENASAVE Green Project” started in fiscal 2009 as part of the “One Million Trees for Local Forests Project,” wherein mangrove seedlings are planted in Thailand and Indonesia using part of proceeds from sales of the fuel-efficient “ENASAVE” tire series.
Mangrove forests are located on seashores and bring a myriad of benefits for local people and their life by providing fertile fishing grounds. The number of trees planted by fiscal 2017 totaled no less than 1.17 million, and we are committed to continuing with our efforts going forward as well.

  Building a Recycling-Oriented Society
Continue to Achieve Complete Zero Landfill
Waste
The Sumitomo Rubber Group is working to reduce, reuse and recycle wastes in order to build a recycling-oriented society.
Complete zero landfill waste is defined as complete diversion of landfill waste, with 100% recycling rate and no waste sent directly to landfills.
We achieved complete zero landfill waste at the Turkey Factory in fiscal 2017.
Reducing Waste Disposal*
We have conducted examinations and other initiatives on new suppliers with the aim of reducing waste disposal. In fiscal 2017, the environmental impact indicator at factories in Japan decreased by 4.0% as compared with the previous fiscal year.
The environmental impact indicator decreased by 13.6% at overseas factories, while decreasing by 17.7% at factories operated by domestic affiliates.
* Waste disposal refers to the amount of waste diverted for thermal/material recycling.
Waste Disposal (Excluding Valuables) (Factories in Japan)
Water Usage Reduction
With the aim of dealing with the global water resource shortage, the Group aims to achieve a wastewater recycling rate of 100% at each factory around the world by 2050. The Thailand Factory is proactively pushing forward with wastewater recycling; it has installed wastewater recycling equipment in the Factory 1 in fiscal 2016 and is planning to implement the same equipment in the Factory 2 in fiscal 2018. The Kakogawa Factory is using recycling equipment for a portion of wastewater and reduced its environmental impact indicator by approximately 19% year on year in December 2017.
The medium-term management plan sets a target of achieving a 100% wastewater recycling rate at two factories by fiscal 2020. The Turkey Factory plans to implement commissioning for establishing recycling technologies in fiscal
2018.In addition, the Group is pursuing reduction of water usage by effectively using rainwater, and in this context, rainwater usage was expanded at the Indonesia Factory in fiscal 2017.
The Group will push forward with water usage optimization in production processes at each base and measures that utilize results of the WBCSD*1 Global Water Tool and WRI*2 Aqueduct water risk assessments on an ongoing basis.

Implementing Global Environmental Management
Enlightening Activities for Environment at Each
Factory
The Group conducts environmental education so that all employees increase their awareness and knowledge about environmental issues and proactively participate in environmental preservation activities.
In fiscal 2017, we conducted activities for communicating information and knowledge on environment- related matters, including holding an “energy-saving assembly” for all employees at the Miyazaki Factory as a new initiative and airing of “environmental voices” public address program at the Zhongshan Factory in China.
These activities will be continued and complemented by other new approaches.
ISO 14001 Global Multi-Site Certification
To implement global management in all of its corporate activities including creation of a low-carbon society, in December 2010, the Group obtained ISO 14001 Global Multi-Site Certification for its 30 bases in Japan and overseas. This enabled us to carry out unified environmental management at major production and development bases in Japan and overseas.
In fiscal 2017, the Turkey Factory obtained the Global Multi-Site Certification and the number of certified factories increased to 32.
In fiscal 2018, the activities will be continued within two factories (South Africa and USA) that have already received individual certification to obtain the Global Multi-Site Certification.
 In fiscal 2018, we are aiming to ensure that this
continues at existing sites. 12

Reduction of Water Usage by Introduction of Wastewater Recycling Equipment
At the Thailand Factory, various initiatives for reducing water usage were implemented but the improvement was limited. Wastewater recycling equipment was introduced as the water utility charge increases drove up manufacturing costs. The water usage has been significantly reduced and water utility charges and costs for recycling waste water have also been saved, as we can recycle wastewater on site.In addition, water pollution risk by wastewater is mitigated, and we plan to introduce the same equipment in Factory 2 as well.
Going forward, we aim to be a factory that contributes to environmental preservation in the region by discharging no wastewater.

  CSR Activity Report
      Management Approach
Underpinning the activities of the Sumitomo Rubber Group is the question “What can tires contribute to the global environment?”. To this end, it is developing environmentally friendly products with a focus on three areas—fuel efficiency, raw materials and resource saving.
While the environment surrounding the automobile industry is facing drastic changes, the Group is pushing forward with development of environmentally friendly products based on its “ENASAVE technology” that allows for “even higher environmental performance.”
Environmentally Friendly Product
Pursuing Safety and Comfort, Economy and Quality
Quality Management System
The Group’s quality management system is structured based on ISO 9001 and the IATF 16949* automobile industry quality management system standards.
The domestic tire factories have completed transition from ISO/TS 16949 to IATF 16949 and the overseas tire factories are sequentially implementing the transition with the overall completion planned in September 2018.
*IATF 16949: Automotive Quality Management System Standard which replaced ISO/TS 16949.
Creation of Airless Tires That Eliminate the Need
for Flat Tire Repairs and Air Pressure Monitoring
The Company is currently working on development of the airless tire technology “GYROBLADE,” a technology composing the “SMART TYRE CONCEPT.”
The fact that no air is filled in “GYROBLADE” eliminates the need for flat tire repairs and tire pressure monitoring, while improving safety. In addition, the tire contributes to resource and energy savings as spare tires will no longer be necessary.
As the airless tire is more prone to heat buildup compared to pneumatic tires, it is equipped with rubber used in fuel efficient tires that provides highly controlled heat generation. In addition, the tire is produced using the next- generation processing method “NEO-T01” that has placed focus on “ultra-high accuracy” in tire manufacturing technology. As exemplified by such facts, the tire is a state- of-the-art technological marvel of the Company. Black sidewalls used in pneumatic tires are replaced with resins for the airless tire, allowing liberal use of colors.
The Company is committed to working on research and development aiming for earlier commercialization of “GYROBLADE” that overturns concepts of conventional tires.

 What Can Tires Contribute to the Global Environment?
  Announcing New Technology Development Concept “SMART TYRE CONCEPT” with an Eye on the Upcoming Mobility Society
Sumitomo Rubber Industries announced, at the “45th Tokyo Motor Show 2017,” a new technology development concept “SMART TYRE CONCEPT” to develop tires delivering safety performance and environmental performance simultaneously and at a higher level anticipated to be required in the mobility society of the future.
performance, the Group is working to develop products with aim to contribute to a recycling-oriented society by utilizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), an element composing the “ENASAVE technology,” and thereby raising the level of environmental performance even higher not only in raw materials and as products in use but also during the entire product life cycle from manufacture and transportation to recycling.
A concept tire using this material is slated for release in 2020.

Aiming for Commercialization of Airless Tires
Following the announcement of our airless concept tires in the Tokyo Motor Show 2015, we displayed and tested airless tires for golf trolleys at the Dunlop Phoenix Tournament in 2016. In addition, automobile manufacturers
  used our airless tires in their concept cars in the Tokyo Motor Show 2017. As such, development of the airless tires aimed at commercialization is steadily making progress.
Although there are some issues to be addressed, we are working to commercialize the airless tires so that many of our customers can experience the benefits of these tires.

General Manager, Advanced Technology Development Department
 This technology concept comprises three technologies: the “safety technology” that supports safety, the “ENASAVE technology” that contributes to the environment and the “core technology” to support them.
In terms of safety performance, while car sharing is becoming increasingly common and progresses are made in autonomous car development, the Group aims to support automobile safety over the long period by suppressing performance degradation due to abrasion and deterioration, realizing a “performance sustaining technology” that enables long- sustained performance of tires equivalent to brand-new ones.

Achieving a Good Work-Life Balance
Helping Employees Balance Work and Family Life
Sumitomo Rubber Industries has introduced various work systems and awareness activities that make it easier for employees to carry out childcare and nursing care; for example, we are reducing the amount of after-hours work employees do, and we are encouraging employees to take their paid leave.
The result of these and other efforts has been that 100% of female employees who have given birth have taken childcare leave. In addition, 13 male employees have taken childcare leave in the past five years.
In fiscal 2009, we became the first company in the tire industry to be certified for the “Kurumin” logo, presented by the Japanese government to companies that strive to help employees raise their children, and we are continuing initiatives to this end.
In fiscal 2014, we introduced the “JOB Return system” aimed to get employees who have left the company to return to work. Under this system, employees who had to quit due to reasons like marriage or their spouse’s job transfer can return to
Promoting Diversity
Expanding Women’s Occupational Range
To promote more active roles for women, we have set the target of doubling the number of women in management positions by 2020, compared with the 2014 level. To this end, we will need to maintain our hiring ratio of female employees and increase initiatives that raise the percentage of people who take paid leave so they can return to work refreshed.
In addition, the number of users of the “daycare support system” under which daycare subsidy is granted to employees who leave their child under two years of age to a daycare facility has been increasing since its institution in fiscal 2015 as a measure to support earlier returning to work from maternity leave and/or
childcare leave. The system is

Creating a Workplace Where Each One of Us Can Play an Active Role
  In order for a female employee to continue working while going through a wide variety of life events, she herself has to have the will of doing so, but additionally, her family needs to understand and cooperate, and her employer needs to put systems in place, create corporate culture and have understanding in her doing so. The Company has instituted a variety of systems to support employees to maintain good balance between work and family life. I myself am working, leaving my son at a nursery school while
utilizing the Company’s daycare support system and receiving support from everyone at my workplace.
It is becoming increasingly more important for the Company, in conjunction with further globalization, to care about not only female employees but also diversified human resources, values and work styles and create a workplace where everyone of us can work energetically. I hope that the Company will continue enhancing the support systems so that every employee can play an active role.

Governments
Thank you as always for purchasing rice in Thailand. That is really wonderful for farmers. We hope that your company further improves the working environment of the factory and continues to provide a wide range of support for us.
Hospitals
We thank you for providing the tires for emergency vehicles. It is actually difficult to operate national hospitals only with the national budget. We hope that you could support maintenance and development of local medical services through donations, etc.
Comments from SRT
Thank you for joining us today and sharing a number of valuable opinions.
We will continue working proactively on various CSR activities so that people in the local communities get to know about SRT, and at the same time improving the working environment in the factory. We are committed to making the company as one that many people think “I want to work at SRT!”
Local communities
The green initiatives undertaken in the industrial estate are really a gift for us in the communities, and we are deeply grateful to your company. We hope that the initiatives be continued not only for ourselves but also for the environment. We also hope that your company considers donations, etc. for temples in the surrounding area.
Schools
We appreciate your green initiatives carried out with our students at school. Now, we request that you consider utilizing tires to be scrapped. I think these tires can be used as play equipment for children at school.
Although the Sumitomo Rubber Group has been working on a wide range of CSR activities, we are going to broaden the scope of the activities even more based also on the opinions you shared with us today.
Furthermore, SRT has been preparing for instituting a student grant program since last year. The grant program under which school expenses of university students are subsidized will be commenced in 2018, and the number of schools eligible for the program will be increased.

Independent Verification Report
Third-Party Comments
To enhance the reliability of this report and the environmental data disclosed on our website, we underwent verification by a third party.
Data marked with “ ” (pages 43 and 44) has been verified.
The target data for verification and the verification criteria used are as follows.
1.Total global CO2 emissions Criteria: ISO 14064-1
2.Water usage, wastewater, and waste disposal (excluding valuables) by factories in Japan Criteria: LRQA’s Report Verification (pursuant to ISAE3000, AA1000AS, and GRI)
The Sumitomo Business Spirit and The SRI Way
The basis for corporate management lies in the management philosophy. As a member of the Sumitomo Group, Sumitomo Rubber Industries carries on the Sumitomo business spirit, and in addition, acts in line with “The SRI Way” that is formulated for the purpose of implementing the Corporate Philosophy. I understand that “The SRI Way” stipulates “values” and “action principles” to be followed by the employees in their day-to-day business (according to the Top Commitment). I think it is wonderful that the company has this policy in which it aims to attain the Corporate Philosophy through demonstration of originality and ingenuity by the employees. I believe that is making contributions to enhanced social value of Sumitomo Rubber products.
Relativity between CSR and the SDGs
The contents of Sumitomo Rubber Industries’ CSR activities are, as I have recognized over the past years, comprehensively and systematically designed. In this year, the relativity with the SDGs is indicated additionally so as to allow clearer understanding of possibility of such activities in contribution to society. It would be necessary in the future to explain the relativity with the SDGs even more specifically and show the originality and ingenuity in making clear how the individual activities can make contributions in their respective fields. I would recommend that, instead of handling all fields evenly, it would be better to set priorities in implementing activities. I think that the relativity between next-generation technologies and SDGs would be particularly important.
Creating an Employee-Friendly Workplace
Sumitomo Rubber Industries is enthusiastically working to create an employee-friendly working environment in aspects such as human resource development, work-life balance and diversity. I am positive that the policy “To Create a Workplace Where Each One of Us Can Play an Active Role” is in steady progress. In the future, a wide variety of work styles will be demanded for activities not only within but also outside the company. Hiring of elderly persons is another important social issue in this society with low birthrates and aged populations. I hope that the company would take actions on these new issues early through a work style reform and thereby create social value as well as energizing the entire company even more.
Communicating with Stakeholders
CSR activities of Sumitomo Rubber Industries are conducted with reference to stakeholders at whom such activities are targeted and the methods of how to communicate with major stakeholders are systematically organized. So, I would suggest that the company could disclose the specific dialogues actually undertaken with the stakeholders. From now on, dialogues with employees who play a central role in CSR are of particular importance. I think one of the roles of this Sumitomo Rubber Group report is to convey the message of how employees think of and implement the Corporate Philosophy.
     Katsuhiko Kokubu
Professor at the Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University
Completed the doctoral program in business administration at Osaka City University Graduate School. After serving as assistant professor at Osaka City University and Kobe University, he assumed his current position in 2001. Head of Graduate School of Business Administration at Kobe University from 2014 to 2016. His recent publications include “From Accountability to Management Ethics” (Yuhikaku Publishing Co., Ltd.) and “CSR Basics” (Chuokeizai-sha, Inc.).
       Response to Third-Party Comments
I would once again like to thank Professor Kokubu for always providing us with pertinent advice and generous evaluations. I agree we must maintain a constant awareness that CSR activities are the basis for enhancing social value, which in turn increases economic value, while maximizing this strategy to the fullest extent possible. We will move forward with examination of specific measures to utilize his advices such as “materializing the relativity with the SDGs,” “accelerating creation of an employee-friendly working environment through a work style reform” and “invigorating dialogues with stakeholders.” Underpinning all this advice is “understanding stakeholder needs,” thus the Group employees will pull together in efforts to promote measures to meet such needs with a progressive perspective and enhance the effective execution and transparency of our activities.

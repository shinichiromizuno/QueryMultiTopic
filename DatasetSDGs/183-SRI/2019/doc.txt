 The Sumitomo Rubber Group and The SRI Way
As a promising and reliable global company that makes significant contributions to improving both communities and society
The Sumitomo Rubber Group upholds “The SRI Way” in order to implement the corporate philosophy.
“The SRI Way” consists of “Values” and “Action Principles” for all of our employees to realize
the “corporate philosophy” and the “management vision” in their day-to-day work, and the “Sumitomo Business Spirit.” “Values” indicate four values, namely, “Integrity and Soundness,” “Communication,” “Set the Bar Higher” and “Cultivate People” in line with the Company’s theme of “What do we consider important?”
“Action Principles” based on these values clearly define “How should we act?”
All of this is based on the “Sumitomo Business Spirit” continuously handed down over 400 years of Sumitomo history.
Origin of the Sumitomo Business Spirit
Masatomo Sumitomo, founding father of the Sumitomo family, left a letter titled “Monjuin Shiigaki” to explain the principles of doing business. His teachings have been passed down over 400 years as the business spirit of Sumitomo, passing through the latter-day “Business Principles,” and have supported management of the Sumitomo Group.
The “Sumitomo Business Spirit” reflects Sumitomo’s strong sense of mission and commitment to improving society: “our business is not only for the benefit of Sumitomo, but for the benefit of the nation and society as well,” and serves as the foundation for the Corporate Philosophy of the Sumitomo Rubber Group.

   Our Top Commitment
 Creating Both Economic Value & Societal Value
The pursuit of societal value, like the pursuit of economic value, is absolutely essential for a company to achieve sustained growth. As a core element of Sumitomo’s business philosophy, this is an idea that has been passed down from generation to generation throughout Sumitomo’s 400-year history.
This year, as we celebrate the 110th anniversary of the founding of Sumitomo Rubber Industries, the Sumitomo Rubber Group still aims to be a corporate group that achieves sustained growth by continually providing “The World’s Best Value” for all of our Stakeholders while at the same time contributing to the development of a sustainable society.
Toward Realizing a Visionary Tire Technology Development Concept & Expanding Our Sports Business
In our Tire Business, the Sumitomo Rubber Group has long been actively engaged in developing and promoting sales of environmentally friendly tires. In light of market changes brought about by technological advancements and the restructuring of industry in general, and with the automotive industry also in the midst of a “once-in-a-century” transformation, in 2017, we unveiled our SMART TYRE CONCEPT(*), a new technology development concept that aims to develop truly groundbreaking tires unlike any the world has seen before—tires that achieve a whole new level of Environmental Performance and Safety Performance. We will continue working to bring our SMART TYRE CONCEPT to fruition as soon as possible so that we may further enhance our value to society while at the same time rapidly developing new products that feature ever greater added value for speedy delivery to market.
In another recent development, the Sumitomo Rubber Group acquired the trademark rights to the DUNLOP brand from Sports Direct International, alongside the company’s DUNLOP sporting goods business and licensing business, in 2017. Following this move, our Group completed the integration of Dunlop Sports into Sumitomo Rubber Industries at the beginning of 2018. Since then, we have been actively engaged in new initiatives to enhance the value of the DUNLOP brand through our involvement in tennis, including becoming the first Japanese company to sign an official sponsorship agreement to supply tournament balls for the Australian Open (one of the four storied Grand Slam tennis tournaments), which is a sure sign of the widespread recognition that we have received for the high quality of our tennis balls as well as our proven track record of supplying balls for major tournaments worldwide. At the same time, through our efforts to enhance the value of the DUNLOP brand, we have also been working to further popularize and revitalize the sport of tennis, such as by supporting the cultivation of the next generation of tennis players at one of the world’s foremost tennis academies. Through these and various other activities, we will continue working toward achieving mid-to-long-term growth for our Sports Business and for the Sumitomo Rubber Group as a whole.
(*) Please refer to Page 23 for further details of our SMART TYRE CONCEPT.
Strengthening Our Global Management System Toward
the Accomplishment of Our Long-Term Vision—VISION 2020
VISION 2020 is the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s Long-Term Vision, reflecting our basic corporate stance of simultaneously pursuing both economic and societal value under our stated goals of “Becoming a True Global Player with High Profits and Rapid Growth” and “Pursuing Enhanced Value for All Stakeholders and Greater Happiness for All Employees.” Toward the accomplishment of these goals, we have chosen “Go for NEXT” as our rallying slogan for VISION 2020 in the hope that it will unite all of our employees with a strong, shared desire to contribute to society for future generations by actively taking on New Challenges. In addition to this slogan, we have also defined three key Growth Engines as pillars to support our overall efforts to take on various New Challenges: the “Challenges of New Markets,” an “Insatiable Drive for Innovation” and “Entering New Business Fields.”
As part of our efforts to take on the “Challenges of New Markets,” we have been working to increase production capacity at our factories in Brazil, Turkey, South Africa and other developing countries with growing markets in order to promote local production for local consumption, while also striving to promote harmonious coexistence with local communities through expanded local hiring to create jobs and contribute to regional development, striving to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and so forth.
Embracing Our “Insatiable Drive for Innovation” to Provide New Value in Terms of Safety, Comfort & the Environment
In keeping with our “Insatiable Drive for Innovation,” we have been actively engaged in research and development activities that aim to answer the big question of “What can tires contribute to the global environment?”—with a focus on three key areas of environmentally friendly product development: Fuel Efficiency, Raw Materials and Resource Savings. In 2020, our Group plans to begin mass production of a new tire that incorporates our proprietary Performance Sustaining Technology to maintain the performance of a tire like brand-new for longer. That same year, we also plan on unveiling a concept tire that incorporates LCA (Life Cycle Assessment), adopting new
materials designed to enhance environmental performance throughout the entire lifecycle of a tire: from raw materials and tire production to shipping, usage and even recycling. Then, in 2023, we plan to unveil a new concept tire that incorporates our proprietary Active Tread Technology, which allows a tire tread to adapt to road conditions for optimized performance in any environment . The Sumitomo Rubber Group will continue these and other R&D efforts towards achieving our long-term goal of completing an all-new tire that incorporates all of our SMART TYRE CONCEPT technologies by the end of the next decade so that we may provide even more new value in terms of Safety, Comfort and the Environment.
When it comes to “Entering New Business Fields,” we have been focusing our efforts on expanding our Healthcare Business. In particular, having acquired a Swiss manufacturer of medical rubber parts in January of 2015, we are now moving to take advantage of the High Quality and High Performance that we have cultivated in the Japanese market to deliver greater safety and peace of mind to medical and caregiving facilities throughout the world.
Striving to Be a Truly Valuable Company with a Strong Sense of Purpose
The Sumitomo Rubber Group will continue to harness these three Growth Engines to tackle the challenges of solving various societal problems toward achieving sure and sustainable growth. In order to better meet the expectations of all of our Stakeholders, we established the SRI WAY as a means of clearly defining the specific Values and Action Principles that we believe our employees should practice and exemplify as they go about their day-to-day work. Toward this same aim, we also strive to engender a corporate culture in which all employees feel a strong sense of purpose while creating workplaces that feature a free and open atmosphere, where employees can encourage one another to do their best and set the bar higher together.
With the recent rise of ESG investment, which emphasizes the importance of non-financial factors (i.e. Environmental, Social, Governance) in investment decisions, it is safe to say that the ideals of SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) are beginning to take root. Guided by our Basic CSR Philosophy and CSR Guidelines as encompassed in the acronym “GENKI,” the Sumitomo Rubber Group is not only working to fulfill our various social responsibilities in terms of compliance and environmental preservation, but also actively applying our advanced technology and R&D capabilities toward solving societal problems and contributing to the realization of a sustainable society for future generations.
On behalf of the Sumitomo Rubber Group, I sincerely hope for and look forward to the continued guidance and support of all or our Stakeholders. In addition, I wish to add that we would very much appreciate your candid thoughts and opinions with regard to this year’s report.

In January 2018, we conducted a management integration with Dunlop Sports Co., Ltd.
We are working to enhance the brand value, mainly within the tennis business, in order to promote synergies between the tire and sports businesses and make the most of the DUNLOP brand.
   Formulate new DUNLOP brand message in racket sports
For the global expansion of the brand, we intend to spread the message “LOVE THE GAME,” which conveys that the brand is for players who seek to not only just win but also enjoy and love the game.

Launch DUNLOP CX series POWERED BY SRIXON
Until now, our tennis rackets have been mainly marketed under the SRIXON brand in Japan while marketed under the DUNLOP brand overseas, but starting with the CX series, which was
launched in December 2018, these
brands were united as the DUNLOP brand, and products will be introduced throughout the world as DUNLOP CX series POWERED BY SRIXON.

  Start new initiatives with IMG Academy
We will also implement the IMG Academy DUNLOP Junior Program and support efforts to discover and train top junior talent. We have also established the Dunlop Innovation Center within the IMG Academy. We will use it as a base for future
development in various ways, such as gathering information on site and testing products with athletes.

  Since the acquisition of the DUNLOP brand business, we have been moving forward with investments in the tennis field to enhance the brand value.
In the future, we will use this to expand activities that increase the brand value for both businesses. Our first attempt at this was creating an ad for the premium comfort tire VEURO VE303 featuring our contracted player Kevin Anderson, who was a 2018 Wimbledon finalist. The ad ran in December 2018. We are promoting sales of DUNLOP tires though DUNLOP collaboration ads between tennis and tires.

We will increase the value of the brand by melding the two businesses.
    
 R&D Activities and Intellectual Property Strategies
Constantly targeting new value creation, the Sumitomo Rubber Group engages proactively in research and development (R&D). In addition to these efforts, the Group preserves the fruits of its research as intellectual property and has established structures to fully capitalize on its intellectual property rights.
balance of both carry and spin. As for tennis rackets, we developed the DUNLOP CX series, which was released in December 2018. Moving the sweet spot toward the tip of the racket not only makes it possible to hit various shots but also reduces the shock at the tip and thus lessens the burden on the player. In addition, using the high resistance urethane material Infinergy®, which is produced by the major German chemical manufacturer BASF, for the interior of the frame makes it possible to realize sufficient carry and a springy feel with a clearer hit. With the management integration in January 2018, we will meet the expectations of customers and actively take on challenges in new fields by fully making use of the research and engineering departments of Sumitomo Rubber Group and developed new, appealing products and services.
R&D expenses in the sports business totaled ¥2.2 billion.
Industrial and Other Products Business
We are actively developing new products aimed at accommodating consumer needs in such fields as vibration control units using high damping rubber, rubber parts for medical applications and precision rubber parts for office equipment.
In the field of vibration control units, the Company conducted in-house shake table experiments simulating real-life earthquake intensity in January 2017 and January 2018 to verify vibration damping control performance of “MIRAIE” ,vibration control system for wooden houses. As a result, the amplitude of the tremor was reduced by up to 95%*. The vibration control dampers, which employ high damping rubber used in MIRAIE, were used for the seismic retrofitting work done on the Kumamoto Castle tower.
R&D expenses in the industrial and other products business totaled ¥1.9 billion.
* The results are based on the in-house shake table experiments and the actual reduction rate will be dependent on the shape of buildings, layout plans and seismic waves.
Intellectual Property Strategies
Basic Policy
The Group proactively carries out intellectual property activities that support its businesses. The Group has set forth a basic policy with regard to such activities in accordance with “VISION 2020,” a long-term vision established in 2012.
Specifically, the Group undertakes intellectual property activities focusing on three pillars, namely: 1) “securing intellectual property rights” with regard to such industrial properties as patents, utility models, designs and trademarks; 2) “exercising such rights” against the infringement of Sumitomo Rubber Industries’ intellectual properties; and 3) “eliminating risk” by developing a structure to defend against attacks by third parties.
Current Status of Basic Policy Implementation
Thanks to the intellectual property education and training for
employees and the introduction of a structure that connects technological development to patent application, the Group has successfully increased the number of high quality patents held.
The Group seeks to effectively utilize its intellectual property rights and enforces such rights against infringement worldwide. For example, in Europe the Group diligently files litigation against infringement while in Asia it is strengthening cooperation with national administrative bodies to ensure that infringing products are seized by customs or their production sites are raided. To secure the competitive advantage of its products and earn greater trust, the Group will constantly reinforce the structure it has built to ensure the protection of its intellectual property rights against such infringement.
Responding to Globalization
In step with the rapid expansion of its overseas operations, the scope of the Group’s intellectual property activities is growing worldwide, encompassing not only Japan but also the USA, Europe and such Asian countries as China as well as Russia and countries in South America, the Middle East and Africa.
Efforts are now under way to nurture human resources and reinforce our structure to conduct intellectual property activities that go along with such globalization. In particular, the Group is providing training sessions not only for Intellectual Property Department members but also for employees at every operational base with the aim of raising awareness of intellectual property and upgrading the competencies of the entire workforce. Such action is facilitating the development of a structure that ensures intellectual property activities are carried out smoothly and seamlessly on a Group-wide basis.
On the other hand, to reinforce the structure, it is essential to cooperate with such external organizations as legal firms, patent agents, research agencies, administrative bodies and judicial organs in Japan and overseas. With the aim of strengthening the connections between the Group and these organizations as well as across-the-board communication, the Group formulates and implements projects that involve internal and external collaborations.
Moreover, the Group renewed its in-house Intellectual Property Management System while reorganizing the department, with the aim of improving operational efficiencies and ensuring that information is shared globally. Through the renewal and reorganization, the Group established a network that connects all of its operational bases and agencies around the world. These actions also facilitated a switchover from paper-based to paperless operations that utilize a workflow system and database, significantly accelerating the Group’s operations and enhancing the security.
Focusing on the abovementioned three pillars, the Group will promote the more efficient implementation of intellectual property activities encompassing all regions worldwide.

As for joint research with the Leibniz Institute for Polymer Research (Dresden, Germany)*, we confirmed that “voids,” micro- gaps within the rubber (the presumed origin of rubber failure), exist at the tips of actual rubber cracks as predicated based on performance analysis, and published the research results in January 2019. It is expected that this will lead to the development of a rubber that is more resistant to wear and less prone to failure. We will continue working to accelerate our efforts to establish the “Performance Sustaining Technology” for tire rubber toward fully realizing our SMART TYRE CONCEPT announced in October 2017.
R&D expenses in the tire business totaled ¥21.7 billion.
* Founded in 1948 as a textile research laboratory attached to a spinning mill, this is one of the largest polymer research facilities in Germany.
Sports Business
Having established R&D sections at both the Sports Business HQ and Roger Cleveland Golf Company, Inc. in the USA, we are developing, evaluating, and testing new technologies and products employing computer simulations and other technologies.
The “Golf Science Center” in Tamba, Hyogo, comprehensively measures, analyzes and evaluates an extremely large volume of data, including profiles of golf clubs and balls and relationships between golf swing forms and clubs, collected by such means as tests using a swing machine and tests on various golfers ranging from top professional golfers to average golfers.
Utilizing these technologies, we developed the NEW SRIXON Z series golf clubs, which were released in September 2018. Introduced under the copy “ZERO SRIXON,” which updates the design principles of conventional SRIXON drivers, all aspects of the driver, including carry, ease, look, and sound when the ball is hit, were transformed, creating a driver appropriate for a wide range of golfers.
For golf balls, we developed and commercialized the NEW SRIXON Z-STAR series. This is the world’s first golf ball in which the high-polymer material SeRM® was used to provide a good

 * Figures for R&D expenses to sales revenue are stated in accordance with JGAAP until 2015, and IFRS after 2016.
With the Sumitomo Rubber Industries’ R&D organization and facilities as its core, the Group promotes R&D activities in wide- ranging fields—the tire, sports, industrial and other products businesses—in close cooperation with its subsidiaries and affiliates around the world.
Total R&D expenses in 2018 amounted to ¥25.8 billion, equivalent to 2.9% of consolidated sales revenue.
Tire Business
“What tire technology can do for the global environment”— Guided by this underlying concept, the Group’s R&D efforts to create environmentally friendly products focus on three areas: “innovative materials,” “fuel efficiency” and “resource conservation,” with the Tire Technical Center, located near the Kobe Head Office, serving as the core facility and in collaboration with the Europe and USA Tire Technical Centers.
A tire sensing technology “SENSING CORE” was introduced in May 2017, which detects slipperiness of the road surface and load on each tire of the four wheels and other data in real time. This technology applies the “Deflation Warning System (DWS)” technology that detects a decrease in air pressure by analyzing wheel speed signals generated from the rotation of tires and makes it possible to make presumptions using software, without the need of any additional sensors.

 Remuneration of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
Remuneration Amount and the Company’s Policies for Determining Its Calculation Method
CSR
Sumitomo Rubber Industries’ remuneration for Directors and Executive Officers consists of basic remuneration and bonuses. The basic remuneration is determined based comprehensively on each individual’s position, duties and responsibilities as well as the Company’s business results. Directors’ remuneration is paid within the framework approved at the Company’s general meeting of shareholders. The amount of each bonus is determined in accordance with an evaluation of the Company’s business results as well as each Director’s business execution. The amount of remuneration for Audit & Supervisory Board Members is determined in discussions among Audit & Supervisory Board Members and paid within the framework approved at the Company’s general meeting of shareholders. Although stock- based incentives are not paid, the Company encourages the purchase of its stock through a stockholding association scheme for Directors and Executive Officers. When determining the amount
of bonuses, the Company also takes into account the contributions made by each individual to the progress of medium- and long-term business plans. In these ways, the Company is providing Directors and Executive Officers with incentives to achieve sustainable business growth. As for performance-based remuneration and stock options linked to medium- and long-term business results, the Company will engage in ongoing in-house discussions as well as dialogue with its shareholders to assess the optimal timing for the introduction and determine the form of remuneration. The Company determines the amount of remuneration for Directors and Executive Officers based on a resolution of the Board of Directors after examining proposals submitted by the “Nomination and Remuneration Committee,” which discusses the matter from objective and unbiased viewpoints, with independent Outside Directors comprising the majority of members.
Activities of the Sumitomo Rubber Group
    Remuneration for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members
The Sumitomo Rubber Group proactively promotes CSR activities under the assumption that not only should efforts be made to raise economic value of the Group, but that it is essential to enhance its social value as well. These endeavors are undertaken in order to realize sustainable growth and the creation of value, as stated in the Group’s VISION 2020 long-term vision.
CSR Guidelines
(Green initiative) (Ecological process)
(Next-generation product development) (Kindness to employees)
(Integrity for stakeholders)
Since 1988, the Group has had in place the “GENKI Activities” project (meaning activities that give everybody energy), in which employees take part in volunteer and environmental conservation activities as a way to contribute to society. These activities have become extended and firmly entrenched throughout the Company and Group. In 2008, GENKI* was set as a keyword in our CSR Guidelines. Employees play a key part in these activities, and therefore ensuring that they are all familiar with this keyword increases awareness of CSR and improves the activities themselves.
*GENKI stands for the five basic categories of our CSR activities: "Green" (Green initiative), "Ecology" (Ecological process), "NEXT" (Next-generation product development), "Kindness" (Kindness to employees) and "Integrity" (Integrity for stakeholders). The word "genki" also means "energetic" in Japanese.

Training the next-generation managers
  The Group is focusing on training next-generation managers and overseas base managers.
A Management School was established so that candidates can acquire skills related to perspective (viewing things as a manager), knowledge (basic knowledge required of management),
and thinking (critical thinking). Starting in 2003, approximately 20 people have been selected each year, and classes are offered throughout the year. Management attends the last meeting, and reports on issues such as future business expansion are provided. This is the training of next-generation managers.
  Implementation and Status of the Internal Control System
 Based on “compliance with social norms,” which is stipulated in the Company’s “Corporate Code of Conduct,” Sumitomo Rubber Industries maintains the guideline that “corporate activities must adhere to laws and ordinances, social norms and standards of public decency.” Moreover, the Company has established “systems to ensure that in the execution of their duties, Directors comply with laws and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and that Group operations undertaken by the Company and its subsidiaries are always appropriate,” thereby securing strict legal compliance. In addition to complying with laws and its Articles of Incorporation, Sumitomo Rubber Industries aims to fulfill its corporate social responsibilities and, to this end, has established a strict code of corporate ethics while pursuing sound business operations. To that end, the Company formulated “Regulations on
Corporate Ethics Activities” in February 2003. Simultaneously and in line with these regulations, the Company established the “Corporate Ethics Committee,” which meets on a quarterly basis and is chaired by the President, with the aim of strengthening its Group-wide compliance system. Furthermore, Sumitomo Rubber Industries set up a “Corporate Ethics Helpline (Compliance Consultation office)” directly controlled by the President as a corporate ethics helpline for employees. This enables the Corporate Ethics Committee to investigate any problems that arise within the Group and give sufficient attention to ensuring that those employees who come forward are not penalized. With a close eye on legal issues, the Company also takes such measures as seeking advice from corporate attorneys as circumstances demand.

 CSR Activity Report
Identifying Materiality and Dialogue with Stakeholders
Taking into account international guidelines and stakeholders’ views, we determined the materiality of CSR-related activities (priority issues).
We have prioritized the 19 indicators of the CSR guidelines, and will further work towards these initiatives.
Stakeholder Dialogues
We periodically carry out surveys to learn about the various opinions and expectations of stakeholders, and while taking their views into account, we also place importance on daily dialogue with stakeholders
How We Communicate with Stakeholders
in pursuing our business activities.
We are conscious of our responsibilities towards stakeholders, and
are working to promote communications through a variety of means.
Materiality Identification Process
To energize the CSR activities of the Sumitomo Rubber Group and become a corporate group trusted by society, in fiscal 2008 the Group formulated its Basic CSR Philosophy and its CSR Guidelines (five areas comprising 13 indicators) made up of the five areas of “Green (green initiatives),” “Ecology (reducing the environmental impact of business activities),” “Next (development of next-generation technologies and products),” “Kindness (kindness to employees)” and “Integrity (integrity for stakeholders).”
In fiscal 2011, we identified which of these 13 indicators in the CSR Guidelines were the most important (their “materiality”).
In fiscal 2014, taking into account the impact on stakeholders and society due to changes in the business environment, we set 19 key CSR indicators.
In fiscal 2015, we prioritized efforts for these 19 indicators, taking into account required content in the “GRI Guidelines (G4)*” and based on a survey of various stakeholders. This report presents the results of such efforts aimed at attaining each CSR target.

                              Management Approach
Forests absorb CO2 which contributes to global warming, and are an important social infrastructure for preserving biodiversity. Based on the thought that preserving this infrastructure is one of our corporate social responsibilities, we promote “Green (Green initiative)” as one part of Sumitomo Rubber Group CSR Activity Guidelines through ongoing tree planting activities in and around our operation bases within Japan and overseas.
In fiscal 2009, we launched the “Million Trees for Local Forests Project” to plant one million trees on and around our facilities around the world in 20 years. We have kept well ahead of our initial 20-year target, reaching a total of 1.78 million trees planted as of fiscal 2018. We will continue to plant trees as well as putting effort in forest maintenance.

 Forestation Activities to Help Curb Global Warming and Connect with Local Communities
“Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest,” a green initiative in Japan
In addition to the grounds of our facilities, we engage in forestation activities in the surrounding area and at the 11 locations (23ha) in Japan designated as “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest.”
When planting trees, one has to be aware of the negative effect non-native species can have on local ecosystem. As such we only plant seedlings grown using acorn seeds that employees and their families gather in the target area. Our continued efforts are aimed at increasing the amount of greenery around us while protecting biodiversity.
While the number of trees planted has been decreasing as the area available for planting is getting smaller, 770 acorn seedlings were planted in “Sumitomo Rubber GENKI Forest” in fiscal 2018.
Team ENASAVE Future
Project, Protecting
Culture and Nature
With the goal of protecting
Japan’s vanishing cultural assets and natural environment, in fiscal 2013 the Group launched the Team ENASAVE Future Project in cooperation with the National Federation of UNESCO Associations in Japan (NFUAJ).
As a part of this project, in fiscal 2018, we held activities at eight locations around Japan, with the help of employees, their families, and local associations. Together with volunteers from the public as well as radio listeners, these events have seen 535 people participate in total.
Preserving Biodiversity
Creation of Regional Biotopes by Hand
The Group is carrying out creation of biotopes within its business bases so that a wide variety of organisms living in these areas may be able to build natural ecosystems unique to such areas.
Five biotopes are now established in total: the Shirakawa Factory “Shirakawa no Izumi,” the Nagoya Factory “Koromo no Izumi,” the Kobe Head Office “Soso no Izumi,” the Miyazaki Factory “Kirishima no Izumi,” and the Ichijima Factory biotope.
The biotopes in those regions were created by the hands of employees on their days off. With the cooperation of local residents, we preserve, nurture and return endemic plants and aquatic life to local areas.

Greening Activities Overseas
We are promoting greening activities at overseas factories and sales companies. We planted a total of 27,792 trees in our tree-planting activities in fiscal 2018.
In addition, 22,000 trees
were planted in Indonesia
through the “Team ENASAVE
Green Project,” wherein mangrove seedlings are planted using some of the proceeds from sales of the fuel-efficient “ENASAVE” tire series. Furthermore 2,400 trees were planted through the “1 Pair for 1 Love activities,” in which some of the proceeds from the sales of rubber gloves are allocated to the DUNLOP Home Products Forest on the island of Borneo, Malaysia, in order to protect the orangutan, an endangered species.

Preservation and Nurturing of Endangered Species
Working with Outside Parties to Protect and
Promote the Breeding of Lefua echigonia
With the biotope in the Ichijima Factory, we are working to protect and breed the Lefua echigonia, an endangered species. The monthly examination involves a detailed examination of the water quality and individuals by members of the Tamba Lefua echigonia Preservation Society, the Tamba Forest Park, which serves as the secretariat, and the professional body Suma Aqualife Park Kobe. Since last year, students in the Biology Club at Hyogo Prefectural Kaibara Senior High School also took part, and the participation of the next generation is providing an opportunity to spread the appeal of the living of the Lefua echigonia.
In the future, we will move forward with accepting requests for environmental education that targets elementary school students in Tamba City and further promote activities to protect valuable local species.

CO2 Emissions Reduction Activities in Production Bases
In fiscal 2018, the Group worked on various fronts, including installing drain pocket to capture condensation from steam. As a result, CO2 emissions in production activities of the Group’s factories in Japan decreased by 1 kt-CO2 to 247 kt-CO2 from the previous fiscal year; however, the environmental impact indicator of CO2 emissions worsened 0.2% over the previous fiscal year. This was because of the impact of increased loads in the manufacturing process.
In fiscal 2019, the Group will work to reduce CO2 emissions by sharing and spreading best practices at each base.
Steampipe drain pocket installed at Hunan Factory (China).
CO2 Emissions Reduction in Logistics
In fiscal 2018, we worked on optimizing the location of our production sites and loading at the closest port to the production factories.
Even though CO2 emissions from transporting tires rose 3.6% compared to the previous fiscal year, to 29.4 kt-CO2, the environmental impact indicator fell 1.2%.

Water Usage Reduction
With the aim of dealing with the global water resource shortage, as a measure to reduce water usage, the Group aims to achieve a wastewater recycling rate of 100% at each factory around the world by 2050. Starting in fiscal 2018, the Turkey Factory, a model factory, launched trial operation in order to establish recycling technology and was able to recycle 25% of factory wastewater at the end of the fiscal 2018. The medium-term management plan sets a target of achieving a 100% wastewater recycling rate at two factories including the Turkey Factory by fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2018, water usage at all factories of the Group declined approximately 5% year on year for various reasons, including recycling wastewater.
The Group will push forward with water usage optimization
in production processes at each base and measures that utilize
results of the WBCSD*1 Global Water Tool and WRI*2 Aqueduct
water risk assessments on an ongoing basis.

Pursuing “Safety and Comfort,” “Economy” and “Quality”
Quality Management System
The Group’s quality management system is structured based on ISO 9001 and IATF 16949* automotive quality management system standards.
Both tire factories in Japan and overseas completed the transition from ISO/TS 16949 to IATF 16949 by August 2018.
*IATF 16949: Automotive Quality Management System Standard which replaced ISO/TS 16949.
Improving the Software Technology for “SENSING CORE,” the Next Generation
Safety Technology
“SENSING CORE” is a technology that senses and avoids dangers due to road surface and tires in advance, by detecting road surface conditions including slipperiness, tire abrasion, load on each tire, air pressure, etc., and using that data to provide the vehicle with feedback. The algorithm has repeatedly been improved since it was introduced in May 2017, making it possible to detect slipperiness of the road surface in a broader range of driving conditions, contributing to greater driver safety and fewer unforeseen accidents.
With the aim of commercializing the technology by 2020, we will look to apply the technology,
Creation of Airless Tires That Eliminate
the Need for Flat Tire Repairs and
Air Pressure Monitoring
The Company is currently working on development of the airless tire technology “GYROBLADE,” a technology composing the “SMART TYRE CONCEPT.”
The fact that no air is filled in “GYROBLADE” eliminates the need for flat tire repairs and tire pressure monitoring, while improving safety. In addition, the tire contributes to resource and energy savings as spare tires will no longer be necessary. As the airless tire is more prone to heat buildup compared to pneumatic tires, it is equipped with rubber used in fuel efficient tires that provides highly controlled heat generation. In addition, the tire is produced using the High-Precision Metal Core Type Manufacturing System “NEO-T01” that has placed focus on “ultra-high
TOPICS
accuracy” in tire manufacturing technology. As exemplified by such facts, the tire is a state-of-the-art technological marvel of the Company. Black sidewalls used in pneumatic tires are replaced with resins for the airless tire, allowing liberal use of colors.
The Company is committed to working on research and development aiming for earlier commercialization of “GYROBLADE” that
overturns concepts of
conventional tires.
      Vibration Control Dampers Using High Damping Rubber Were Adopted for the Kumamoto Castle Tower
Vibration control dampers made by the Company were adopted for seismic retrofitting work currently in progress on the Kumamoto Caster Tower.
The Company’s vibration control dampers employ high damping rubber developed with cutting-edge technology acquired while creating car race tires. The viscoelastic dampers absorb tremors by instantaneously transforming the energy of earthquakes into heat. This high damping rubber is also used in “MIRAIE” ,vibration control system for wooden houses, and demonstrated its features in the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake.

Distinguishing Features
of the Company’s Vibration Control Dampers
Resistant to earthquake tremors and swaying due to high wind
They are effective against major earthquakes, subsequent aftershocks, and wind-caused swaying in everyday life.
Can be installed in small spaces
Although they are compact, the dampers sufficiently control vibrations.
Resistant to repeated tremors
They are effective for repeat aftershocks because of the stability of the rubber.
No maintenance required
It is not necessary to conduct maintenance over the long term. Outstanding durability makes it perfect for earthquakes.
    Tire-sensing Technology “SENSING CORE” Received the “Tire Technology of the Year”
The tire-sensing technology “SENSING CORE” received the “Tire Technology of the Year,” which is given to outstanding cutting-edge technology, at the “Tire Technology International Awards for Innovation and Excellence” held within the “Tire Technology Expo* 2019” in Hanover, Germany.
This is the third time the Company received the award, having won it for the “4th Generation Run-Flat Tire Technology” in 2010 and the new material development technology “ADVANCED 4D NANO DESIGN” in 2017.
This award shows that both the Company’s pioneering initiatives, which are not limited to tire manufacturing, and the realization of that technology were highly rated, while the environment surrounding the automobile industry is facing drastic changes. The Company will continue to move forward with
the development of technology and contribute to
the development of a mobility society that is safe
and places little burden on the environment.

Fostering Human Resource Development and Making Jobs Rewarding
Fostering Human Resources
The Group conducts human resource development through combination of three components: OffJT such as group training, etc., OJT at each division, and self-study.
In order for the Company to survive as a true global player in this volatile era, employees must be able to communicate regardless of differences in culture and language and to solve problems. Therefore, we have planned grade-specific training starting from when employees are young so that they can acquire critical thinking and problem solving skills.
In addition, we have created an environment in which all staff employees can take e-learning courses as much as they want in order to support the desire of employees to learn even outside of group training.
As one effort to make jobs more rewarding, we launched “COMPAIT * Activities” and implemented company-wide in 2018, and
are promoting efforts to raise operational efficiency.
* COMPAIT (COMPAIT STAR) refers to efforts to (1) make meetings short and fulfilling (COMpact), (2) go PAperless, (3) introduce IT, and (4) STAndardize operations.
Manufacturing Education
The Group has placed a strong emphasis on education on manufacturing technology and craftsmanship in Japan and overseas. In fiscal 2018, workplace supervisors and young employees in Production Department were provided with training on manufacturing education. The same training was provided both in Japan and overseas, and a total of 1,642 employees took part in the training.
In addition, for workplace supervisor training, the focus was on content that could be put to subsequent practical use. In order to raise the level of managers, efforts are made to establish a company-wide consistent philosophy regarding roles of managers, operations, important management items for manufacturing, and other aspects, and to spread that throughout factories in not only Japan but also overseas.
Furthermore, the Skill Olympics, which began in 2009, have contributed to improvement and transfer of skills among 12 factories around the world. Some engineers from overseas factories have won the championship in the Skill Olympics in recent years, and this initiative is contributing to heightening of skills and motivation on a global scale.
Creating a Safe, Employee-Friendly Workplace
Striving to Zero Accident
With the aim of Zero danger and accident in the workplace, the Group carries out safety activities that eliminate the causes of accidents and fundamentally raise the level of safety. The Group also proactively conducts physical safety audits and visual checks on site.
As for safety, although the number of accidents during fiscal 2018 increased by 12 year on year, we successfully prevented serious accidents. Regarding accident prevention targets, the Group will not have Zero fatal accident in fiscal 2019 and will not exceed 35 accidents (half the number in fiscal 2018). We will use leading safety indicators (KPI) to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of safety activities and will apply that information to those safety activities.
By doing so, we will move forward with efforts to create a work environment and culture in which all employees ensure safety and we will achieve zero accidents, which is a priority issue.
Promoting Health & Productivity Management
In line with the “Health & Productivity Management Declaration” set in February 2018, the company promoted to realize health & productivity management through the participation of all employees in cooperation with the Health Insurance Association, centered on the Health Management Office. As for reducing the number of days of physical sick leave, an issue of particular importance, the results of various types of health activities newly undertaken were announced, and the number of such days fell 13% over the previous fiscal year.

 In addition, the number of people who tried telecommuting increased in 2018 since the requirements to try it were loosened on a trial basis. In 2019, therefore, we will verify the results and move forward with an examination of fully introducing the system. We will continue to expand and implement systems that create a work environment that meets the specific lifestyle needs of employees.
Promoting Diversity
Respecting Diversity
With the goal of becoming a company in which diverse employees can pleasantly work and fully demonstrate their skills, we are promoting more diversity in employment types and the creation of a pleasant work environment.
Expanding Women’s Occupational Range
To promote more active roles for women, the company has set the target of doubling the number of women in management positions by 2020, compared with the 2014 level. In order to achieve that goal, we are moving forward with efforts to expand the work-life balance systems so that employees who have experienced various life events can play active roles and to raise the
percentage of people who take paid leave so they can return to work refreshed.
In addition, the number of
users of the “daycare support
system” under which daycare

to a daycare facility has been increasing since its introduction in 2015 as a measure to support earlier returning to work from maternity leave and/or childcare leave. The system is contributing to career development of female employees.
Respect for Human Rights
Basic Perspective on Consideration for Human Rights
The Group’s Corporate Code of Conduct states that we “maintain a sound working environment free from discrimination on the basis of belief, creed, religion, race, skin color, nationality, language, social background, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical handicap or other reason.” Accordingly, we strive to prevent infringement of human rights of any employee.
We also distributed handbook on human resources and occupational management to all managers and held training sessions and lectures to ensure awareness of the handbook’s content as part of our efforts to create a workplace free of human rights infringements and harassment, where employees can work energetically.
Making Use of Telecommuting Trial and Realizing a Work-Life Balance
   Over past 21 months, I used telecommuting trials 18 times. In the past, I could use only flextime or paid leave for class observation days of elementary school and teacher’s home visits, but using telecommuting on trial basis, I have reduced commute time. Combining this with paid leave in increments of hours and other systems has made it possible to fully fulfill my responsibilities as a parent
while minimizing the impact on my work. I really appreciate that.
While working from home is convenient, there were problems with communicating with both parties in and outside the company, managing attendance, and creating a work environment at home. Even so, I would like to help out by giving my opinion to create a fuller system.

Promoting social contribution activities
CSR Fund
In fiscal 2009, the Company established the “Sumitomo Rubber Industries CSR Fund” for the financial support of groups working on social issues such as environmental preservation and disaster recovery support in the regions where we have business sites. All donations from employees in support of the Fund are sorted by the Company under its “matching-gift” program and organizations receiving funds are selected based on recommendations made by our business sites and an NPO intermediary support center.
In fiscal 2018, the Fund donated a total of ¥8.93 million to 39 organizations located in seven regions: Fukushima, Tokyo, Aichi, Osaka, Hyogo, and Miyazaki Prefectures and Thailand.
In fiscal 2019, a total of ¥11.09 million will be donated to 47 organizations.

Activities Closely Connected
with Local Communities
The Group promotes social contribution activities closely connected to local residents living near our factories. Employees play a key part in engaging in projects promoting exchanges with local residents to deepen relationships of trust and resolve issues by cultivating an environment enabling mutual understanding.
The Savignac L’enchanteur: The Magic of Parisian Posters exhibition was held at the Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Arton October 27 (Saturday) – December 24 (Monday/national holiday), 2018. At the exhibition, we collaborated with the museum to provide a photo booth that reproduced Dunlop Tires, one of the Savignac’s top pieces of art.
In cooperation with an NPO, we held the DUNLOP Manufacturing Class to put together a simple art kit for 5th graders and up as an event affiliated with the same museum.
Supply Chain Management
Engaging in CSR Procurement Along
with Suppliers
The Group has formulated a CSR Code of Conduct, which covers regulatory compliance, human rights and labor ethics, and includes it the Procurement Guidelines, which are distributed to all suppliers.
Furthermore, we regularly conduct CSR questionnaires at supplier companies and widely promote CSR within the supply chain through holding CSR briefings given the results. In fiscal 2017, we conducted CSR questionnaires at 260 supplier companies and held CSR briefings six times. There are plans to use a similar questionnaire and to hold briefings in 2020, too.
Furthermore, we provide explanations of our CSR Code of Conduct to new suppliers using the Procurement Guidelines and use the CSR questionnaire to conduct a self-evaluation.
Establishing a
“Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy”
The Company was pleased to announce our participation in the launch of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR) as a founding member. As a participant in GPSNR, the Sumitomo Rubber Group has also established our own “Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy” with the aim of making natural rubber a sustainable resource for the future, and announced the policy on November 16, 2018 . The establishment of this new platform, which aims to set global standards for sustainable natural rubber, was initiated by the CEOs of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Tire Industry Project (TIP) in November of 2017 and finalized with a launch event held in Singapore on October 25, 2018. In striving to
is the primary raw material in our main product: tires.
With global demand for tires expected to grow alongside the development of the mobility societies of the future, there is growing concern about the problems that may arise from increased demand for natural rubber, such as environmental damage caused by deforestation in regions that produce natural rubber or human
rights violations associated with poor working conditions.
Since joining the Sustainable Natural Rubber Initiative (SNR-i) established by the International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) in October 2016, our group has been actively pursuing independent
sustainability efforts.
Now, with our participation in GPSNR, our group is
committed not only to promoting more proactive, collaborative efforts that involve both supply chains and various other stakeholders, but also to redoubling our own efforts toward attaining natural rubber sustainability in accordance with our newly established “Sustainable Natural Rubber Policy.”

   Focus Efforts on Increasing Interest of the Next Generation in Science
 Touting education support as one of its core activities, Core-net approached Sumitomo Rubber Industries with the desire to do something about the tendency of children not to be interested in science. As one part of Sumitomo Rubber Industries’ 100th anniversary, Core-net held the DUNLOP Manufacturing Class, which provided hands-on instruction in manufacturing. Since 2009, the class has been jointly offered with Sumitomo Rubber
Industries to 4,235 students at 55 elementary schools. During the classes, students are pushed to think about why things occurs, and a scientific approach has been developed, including some children conducting independent research on why somethings are straight and others bend or why something is quick or slow and
then submitting a report.
We will continue to make these efforts.

 CSR Activity Report Stakeholder Dialogue
CSR Activities in the Indonesia Factory
 PT Sumi Rubber Indonesia (SURINDO), which is located in Karawang Regency, Indonesia, adopted a policy of contributing to the environment and undertook various CSR activities to harmonize with the local community. This time, we invited stakeholders and had a dialogue in order to further expand SURINDO’s activities.

At SURINDO, we are expanding our wide-ranging activities, such as environmental preservation and local community support.

 Cikampek District Chief Syueb Sulaiman
It is my opinion that the various CSR activities that SURINDO conducts are important to maintain good relations with the local community. I hope that under the concept of genchi-genbutsu, the Company continues to undertake activities that meet the expectations of society.
Local resident representative (local reporter) Mr. Rudi
Poverty is a problem in the suburb of Karawang Regency. The donations of daily necessities are really appreciated. There are still many residents who require the activities of SURINDO, and I hope that donations continue to be made.
Kalihurip Village Chief Jajang Herman
CSR activities are extremely beneficial for the local community. Regrettably, however, the activities do not extend to the village of Kalihurip, which is the closest to SURINDO. In the future, I hope that the activities are firmly rooted in the local area.
Rawamas Estate Neighborhood Chief Warsid
As for dengue fever-related activities, the Rawamas Estate is large, so there are still areas where fogging has not been done. We request more support to eradicate dengue fever such as increasing the number of times of fogging to be conducted from once to twice a year.
Cilamaya, Village Chief Bakri
Mangroves are necessary for marine creatures to breed, and this helps maintaining the ecosystem. One method is to plant a lot of trees at a single time, but it is important to maintain the work. We would like to request that 1,000– 2,000 trees be planted each year.
Kalihurip Elementary School (2), Sendi Sukandi
The donation of school goods to the children was extremely helpful. We are currently struggling with the fact that although children are extremely interested in learning, there is no library. We request your cooperation with book donations in order to raise children’s knowledge and ability to think.
Comment from SURINDO
SURINDO President Toshio Koyama
Kalihurip Elementary School (1), Tatang Rucita
Thank you for donating goods useful for learning, such as whiteboards. We hope that you will next help build a fence around the school. We request your cooperation because a fence would secure the safety of the children.
Indotaisei Industrial Estate, General Affairs Section Deputy Manager Bondan Susilo
SURINDO is the most cooperative among the industrial estate’s volunteer clubs. In the second half of 2019, there are plans to conduct various activities related to health and education at 8 villages. We would like you to continue to actively participate in these activities.
SURINDO Plant Director Yoshikazu Tanaka
SURINDO contributes to society through its business—that is, providing society with safe tires. In addition, it is my opinion that factories should place importance on harmony between the environment and local communities. We would like to use the opinions obtained today to grow with all the local residents. Therefore, we hope for your continued support.
                    I would like to thank everyone for taking time out of your busy schedules to be here today. SURINDO has undertaken CSR activities to reinforce the relationship of trust we have built with all stakeholders, and these have been based on the Company’s policies and idea until now. We have listened to everyone’s opinions this time and would like to use those for future activities.

Third-Party Comments
     Katsuhiko Kokubu
Professor at the Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University
Completed the doctoral program in business administration at Osaka City University Graduate School. After serving as assistant professor at Osaka City University and Kobe University, he assumed his current position in 2001. Head of Graduate School of Business Administration at Kobe University from 2014 to 16. Also serves as Vice President of Kobe University since 2019. His recent publications include “From Accountability to Management Ethics” (Yuhikaku Publishing Co., Ltd.) and “CSR Basics” (Chuokeizai-sha, Inc.).
Value Chain and ESG
The main topic of this year’s Sumitomo Rubber Group Report is the integration of the value chain and ESG (environmental, social, governance). Creating value through the value chain is now the foundation of corporate management, but it is not easy to expand that to ESG.
Information on business activities can ultimately be summarized in numbers, such as profits, but that is not true for ESG activities. Since each process of ESG activities has a unique impact, it is extremely important to look throughout the whole value chain when managing ESG.
It is my opinion that Sumitomo Rubber Group integrating its value chain and ESG is a great step forward. I hope that in the future this structure will correspond to identification of materiality, targets, and actual results, to be utilized in their corporate management.
Detailed Corporate Governance Information
As for how Japanese companies’ CSR activities compare to those of other countries, it is said that although Japanese companies do better than European and American companies in terms of environmental issues and are on par with those companies in terms of social issues, they lag behind them in regard to governance. Sumitomo Rubber Group’s report makes an effort to provide more information on governance, which I highly appreciate. Detailed information on the holding of committee meetings and remuneration for directors are disclosed, which reveals the extent of the governance system. In the future, it will probably be important to disclose information so that people understand the thoughts of directors and other officers on CSR. Governance is not limited to “governing” but also includes leading companies in a better direction. Therefore, the opinions individual members of the management have are important message for evaluating CSR.
Relationship between Social Issues, including SDGs
The table of the Sumitomo Rubber Group’s CSR Efforts shows how they connect to SDGs, but the connection for individual activities are not necessarily clearly explained. CSR activities are no longer perceived as compliance-like activities that companies are obliged to carry out. Companies are moving forward with actively resolving social issues and linking that to corporate value. The level of Sumitomo Rubber Group’s activities is extremely high, and the question becomes how those are related to goals set by society, such as SDGs. Are there other fields that the Sumitomo Rubber Group can make contributions to? How can employees be motived to find solutions to social problems? If the activities are expanded towards these directions, it may be possible to achieve even more meaningful results.
       Response to Third-Party Comments
I would once again like to thank Professor Kokubu for always providing us with pertinent advice and generous evaluations. I agree we must maintain a constant awareness that CSR activities are the basis for enhancing social value, which in turn increases economic value, while maximizing this strategy to the fullest extent possible.
Several issues, including the following, were pointed out: let the matrix of value chain and ESG correspond to the identification of materiality, targets, and actual results, and using that in the management of the Company; disclosing the opinions on CSR by directors and other officers; the connection between the Company’s activities and social goals, such as SDGs; whether there are other fields that contributions can be made in; and what incentives to motivate employees to solve social issues. We will move forward with a concrete examination of these.
Underpinning all this advice is “understanding stakeholder needs,” thus the Group employees will pull together in efforts to promote measures to meet such needs with a progressive perspective and enhance the effective execution and transparency of our activities.

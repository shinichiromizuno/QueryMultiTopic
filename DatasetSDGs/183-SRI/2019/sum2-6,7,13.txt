Creating a Low-Carbon Society
Items marked with “ ” have been verified by third parties. The environmental impact indicator was not verified by third parties. The figures shown on the graphs differ from the verified figures as different coefficients were used.
CO2 Emissions Reduction Activities in Production Bases
In fiscal 2018, the Group worked on various fronts, including installing drain pocket to capture condensation from steam. As a result, CO2 emissions in production activities of the Group’s factories in Japan decreased by 1 kt-CO2 to 247 kt-CO2 from the previous fiscal year; however, the environmental impact indicator of CO2 emissions worsened 0.2% over the previous fiscal year. This was because of the impact of increased loads in the manufacturing process.
In fiscal 2019, the Group will work to reduce CO2 emissions by sharing and spreading best practices at each base.
Steampipe drain pocket installed at Hunan Factory (China).
CO2 Emissions Reduction in Logistics
In fiscal 2018, we worked on optimizing the location of our production sites and loading at the closest port to the production factories.
Even though CO2 emissions from transporting tires rose 3.6% compared to the previous fiscal year, to 29.4 kt-CO2, the environmental impact indicator fell 1.2%.

Continue to Achieve Complete Zero Landfill Waste
The Sumitomo Rubber Group is promoting the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) of waste in order to build a recycling-oriented society. In fiscal 2018, we achieved complete zero landfill waste for the ninth consecutive year.
Complete zero landfill waste is defined as complete diversion of landfill waste, with 100% recycling rate and no waste sent directly to landfills.
In fiscal 2019, we are aiming to ensure that this continues at existing sites.

Efforts to Reduce Organic Solvents Use
The Group has been making voluntary efforts to reduce VOC (volatile organic compounds) consumption. In fiscal 2018, however, it rose slightly from the previous fiscal year because of an increase in its usage in products other than tires, even though improvements were made to the production process.
In fiscal 2019, we will further optimize usage conditions of VOCs and reduce quantities used.

Philippine Factory Launched Environmental
Preservation Activities as a Member of the
Sumitomo Rubber Group
As a member of the Sumitomo Rubber Group, Dunlop International (Philippines) Inc., the Philippine Factory that produces Dunlop tennis balls used even in the Australian Open, launched environmental preservation activities.
In fiscal 2018, the factory conducted cleaning activities of the river that flows by the factory and made environmental contributions to the local communities. Starting in 2019, it will launch efforts to reduce its environmental burden (CO2 emissions, waste disposal, organic solvent use, and water use). In fiscal 2019, the first year of efforts to reduce its environmental burden, the factory plans to reduce 1% for each item compared to the previous fiscal year.
The goal is to become a tennis ball factory that is beloved by tennis players throughout the world, while promoting greater product quality, environmental preservation, and work safety.

   Reducing Waste Disposal*
In order to reduce waste disposal, various efforts have been undertaken, including finding a recycling company to sell steel scrap, but in fiscal 2018, the environmental impact indicator for factories in Japan deteriorated 21% as compared with the previous fiscal year.
The environmental impact indicator worsened 48.5% at overseas factories, while decreasing by 15.5% at factories operated by domestic group companies.
* Waste disposal refers to the amount of waste diverted for thermal / material recycling.

Water Usage Reduction
With the aim of dealing with the global water resource shortage, as a measure to reduce water usage, the Group aims to achieve a wastewater recycling rate of 100% at each factory around the world by 2050. Starting in fiscal 2018, the Turkey Factory, a model factory, launched trial operation in order to establish recycling technology and was able to recycle 25% of factory wastewater at the end of the fiscal 2018. The medium-term management plan sets a target of achieving a 100% wastewater recycling rate at two factories including the Turkey Factory by fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2018, water usage at all factories of the Group declined approximately 5% year on year for various reasons, including recycling wastewater.
The Group will push forward with water usage optimization
in production processes at each base and measures that utilize
results of the WBCSD*1 Global Water Tool and WRI*2 Aqueduct
water risk assessments on an ongoing basis.

Implementing Global Environmental Management
Environmental preservation is one of the most important responsibilities that companies must fulfill within global society. There are strong demands that global companies implement uniform environmental management throughout the world regardless of country or region.
While accelerating its global expansion, the Group is focusing even greater energy on promoting global environmental management.
Global Environmental Management System
In order to strengthen global environmental management, the Group established the Global Environmental Management Central Committee, which is mainly composed of responsible parties at bases in Japan and overseas and those responsible for issue-specific working groups.
Switzerland Factory Report
ISO 14001 Global Multi-Site Certification
To implement global management in all of its corporate activities including creation of a low-carbon society, in December 2010, the Group obtained ISO 14001 Global Multi-Site Certification for its 30 bases in Japan and overseas. This enabled us to carry out unified environmental management at major production and development bases in Japan and overseas.
In fiscal 2018, two factories (South Africa and the USA) that have already received individual certification, obtained the Global Multi-Site Certification, and the efforts were expanded to 34 bases. We will continue these activities in fiscal 2019, with the goal of obtaining Global Multi-Site Certification for both the Switzerland Factory and Philippines Factory. (km3)

The committee meets twice a year. In fiscal 2018, it met in February and July. At the meetings, there were reports by the Manufacturing Department on a wide range of activities, including actual results and improvements in various indicators such as CO2 emissions, energy savings, waste disposal, and water usage, as well as efforts to improve the environment (offensive odors, etc.) and social contribution activities. Furthermore, the USA Factory and Switzerland Factory reported their environmental activity for the first time in fiscal 2018. There were also reports on reducing CO2 emissions through fuel efficiency technology by the Technology Development Department, introducing environmentally friendly products and environmental preservation activities by the Sales Department, and other topics. The reports were followed by lively discussions.
In the future, the activities of the various bases will be enlivened by sharing information globally through the committee and hard work.

All Environmental Targets Achieved in Fiscal 2018
The tennis ball factory in Thailand achieved all environmental targets (energy savings, waste disposal, water, and organic solvents) in fiscal 2018. There is a particularly strong focus on energy savings, and activities to make improvements in the short and long term are undertaken, with the aim of contributing to the efficient use of energy. In fiscal 2018, the factory reduced the environmental impact indicator 3.8%, dramatically surpassing the target of 0.5%, even under reduced production because of various efforts, including reducing the diameter of the steam nozzle used in the tennis ball napping process and increasing insulation on steampipes used in the pressing process.
For fiscal 2019, there are plans to introduce automatic combustion system for the boiler, which is recommended by and
supported by governments.

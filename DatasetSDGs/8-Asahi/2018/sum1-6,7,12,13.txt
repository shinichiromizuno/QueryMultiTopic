Environmental Initiatives 
At the Asahi Group, we recognize that water, agricultural products, and other “gifts from nature” are essential for us to carry out our business activities. Not only are we endeavoring to reduce the burden on the environment, but we are also developing initiatives to create value that can actually enhance the environment so as to enable us to consistently deliver on our great taste promise, pursuing excellence in quality. We will continue working toward the realization of a sustainable society hand in hand with business growth. 
Direction of Initiatives 
	•	Through the initiatives of the newly instituted Asahi Group Environmental Vision 2050, we will reduce business risks while exceeding the expectations of our stakeholders and contributing to a sustainable society through our business growth.  
	•	Through environmental information disclosure in line with the rules (global, accurate, transparent) regarding the disclosure of environmental information and data as non-financial information, we will work to improve our corporate value.

Achieve Water Neutrality at Domestic Beer Factories by 2025 
We will further reduce water use at our plants and obtain Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification while practicing sustainable forest management at our company forest (Asahi Forest) and enhancing groundwater recharge capabilities (a forest’s capacity to capture and store water). We will aim for water neutrality at our domestic beer plants by 2025 by equalizing the amount of water used at our plants with the amount of water the forest captures and stores.

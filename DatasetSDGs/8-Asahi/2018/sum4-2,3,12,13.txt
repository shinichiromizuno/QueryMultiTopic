The Asahi Group’s CSV Positioning Strategy 
To date, we have pursued CSV with products that consumers can enjoy. However, to create new value with higher levels of quality, we believe we need to create unique value in the domains of raw materials and ingredients. To that end, we have been promoting CSV in terms of agricultural products, such as rice and soybeans, and livestock, such as chickens, by using agricultural and livestock materials. Going forward, we will further extend the scope of these efforts, expanding the lineup of targeted products and focusing our efforts on creating new value.

Mitigating environmental load through business
Kanro aims to mitigate environmental load in every process of its business activities. We also work to proactively collaborate with the supply chain to realize the fair and sustainable procurement of raw materials.
   
In order to contribute to tackling the now-urgent matter of climate change, Kanro installed solar panels at our Asahi Plant in June 2015 and at our Hikari Plant in June 2019 to promote clean energy initiatives. In addition, we are working to reduce the environmental load from product packaging and packaging materials. In 2019, by switching the materials used in the inner boxes of our core products from corrugated cardboard to a recyclable monofilm, we were successful in reducing the size of each case and achieved a reduction in CO2 from product transportation and from packaging materials. This also made significant contributions to reducing distribution costs. Going forward, we will continue to promote further volume reduction
and simplification, and work to
reduce the environmental load of
product packaging by switching
to environmentally friendly materi-
als.

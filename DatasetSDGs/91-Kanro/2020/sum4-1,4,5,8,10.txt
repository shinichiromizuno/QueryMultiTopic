Promotion of human rights and diversity
The growth of each and every one of our employees and their pride in their job duties support the growth of Kanro. Kanro creates a safe and rewarding working environment while respecting individuality to allow diverse employees to play an active role.

Promotion of Telecommuting and Cultural Reform
Kanro promotes telecommuting as one measure toward working style reform. After a test run in June 2019, presentations were made company-wide in February 2020, with full-scale implementation beginning in March. By expanding employee options for where and when they work, we are striving to enhance work-life balance, improve autonomy, bolster management skills of our managers, leverage ICT, an improve work efficiency. In addition, in order for Kanro to grow through the next hundred years, we need diverse human resources who can take on challenges without fear of change. In addition to improving systems and environments, we will bring about change in the awareness and culture of employees, forming new work styles by disseminating information through in-house social media and other channels.
Training session on LGBT understanding
In January 2020, we held a training session on LGBT understanding. We provide opportunities for each employee to think on the matter so that all members of our diverse workplace including LGBT people will be able to play their full part.

Corporate governance
In order to become a company trusted and needed by society, Kanro engages in fair business and highly transparent organizational operation. The Company listens to the opinions of stakeholders at all times and reflects them in management decisions.

Briefing sessions for individual investors
In order to hear more investor voices, we plan to hold a number of briefings for individual investors. Three of these were held in 2019. Kanro’s vision is to make brighter futures infused with sweetness as the world’s top confectionary. We appeal to investors with this vision using three facets: the necessity of sugar, an organizational culture of chal- lenge, and product creation that values its materials. The Company listens to the opinions of stakeholders at all times and uses them in its management decisions.

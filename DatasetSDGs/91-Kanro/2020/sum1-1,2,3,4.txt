Creating value through Sweetness
Kanro disseminates correct information on the value of sugar and contributes to the realization of a better society through products that help lead to a healthy life and candy that brings joy, fun and moments of happiness.
Relevant SDGs
     
We want our candies to be the spark that bring people closer together. Because of that, weâ€™ve developed a unique educational program that communicates the importance of human relationships to the children who will lead the next generation. Kanro employees go out to local elementary and middle schools, and even work with employee families to educate people. As of 2018, we have also been conducting annual onsite classes, disaster area tours, garbage cleanup walks, and more in collaboration with the Iwaki City Board of Education in Fukushima Prefecture. These initiatives are aimed at helping kids grow up healthy and strong, and to raise awareness of CSR activities among participating employees.

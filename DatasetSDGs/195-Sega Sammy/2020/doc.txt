 A Message from the CEO
The Social Value of Entertainment
With the rampant worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we would like to express our deepest sympa- thies to all those affected and pray for the earliest possible recovery for all who are suffering. We would also like to express our deep gratitude to all healthcare professionals and those who are working hard to contain the spread of this virus.
In the midst of this unprecedented crisis, entertainment has often been categorized as a “non-essential, non-urgent” activity. In that sense, I feel that this pandemic differs in quality from the many challenges the Group has faced so far in its history. To overcome this adversity, the Group must transform its business model, including the ways in which we provide services and products, in response to sweeping changes in society. On the other hand, even if the current disaster is pro- longed, I believe the essence of entertainment will never change. Since the dawn of history, when faced with unimag- inable crises, human beings have sought daily refreshment and enjoyment from entertainment. Entertainment has been passed down and evolved to suit the times, helping to form cultures that make the world a richer place and contributing to the development of society.
Under public health measures directing people to refrain from going out, many entertainment facilities which involve contact between people have been forced to suspend their operations. On the other hand, new ways of playing and enjoy- ing the arts using the internet are showing signs of growth. This is a testament to people’s desire for entertainment no matter what the circumstances. If people’s hearts are not healthy and content, they will be unable to overcome the over- whelming feeling of being locked up that pervades society. I am proud to lead a company that can create such wonderful entertainment. I feel more strongly than ever that this enter- tainment is the greatest value we can offer to society.
Entertainment Is Precisely the Greatest Value Our Group Can Offer to Society.
   02
Breakthrough Power for a Post-COVID Era
Our Group is part of an industry that relies on hit products. If a company puts out a big hit, it can boost its market share and even dominate the field. Naturally, there are no set rules for how to go about making a blockbuster title. What I can say from my experience so far, however, is that if you strive to create something new while drawing on “breakthrough power,” it is sure to pay off in the end. In other words, if a com- pany has the courage to pursue innovative ideas, and per- sists in striving to create products and services to the most excellent possible level, users will respond with great enthu- siasm. Making the movie Sonic the Hedgehog was my
long-cherished dream ever since the birth of the SEGA SAMMY Group. It took more than 10 years from conception, but the movie was finally released in the U.S. in February 2020, becoming a huge hit. I think it was “breakthrough power” that made this happen.
Going forward, to create value that exceeds the expec- tations of our customers, we will continue striving to foster a culture with “breakthrough power,” in which each and every employee pours their imagination and passion into a proj- ect, never giving up until they accomplish it. I am convinced that our repeated efforts to do this will allow us to keep
providing experiences that move the heart to people —the essence of the SEGA SAMMY Group—even in a post-COVID era. We would like to ask our investors and stakeholders for their continued support.

Beast King series
The first Beast King title was released in 2001. This was the machine that set off the AT* machine boom, which is a central chapter in the history of pachislot machines. With its “Savannah Chance,” the innovative, medal-increasing gameplay that overturned conventional concepts of pachislot, Beast King attracted a wide range of fans and became a huge hit, generating sales of 140,000 units. Subsequent series have continued to evolve and continue to attract users even today.

Many of the Group’s businesses are “hit-making businesses,” in which continuous investment in development is required to generate hit titles, and the presence or lack of a hit has a significant impact on earnings. Financial stability and cash flow generated by the Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business and other segments underpin stable development investment, and are also the foundation that enable the Group to continue doing business in pursuit of future growth, even amid harsh operating conditions.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 INTRODUCTION

 A Message from the COO
Looking back on Road to 2020 and the Impact of COVID-19
The SEGA SAMMY Group announced Road to 2020, a medium-term management plan with the aim of realizing our long-term vision based on the Group’s mission of Constantly Creating, Forever Captivating —Making Life More Colorful—. In the final year of the plan, the operating income margin was 7.5% and ROA was 3.0%, which fell short of our targets of an operating income margin of at least 15% and ROA of 5%.
For the Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business, Road to 2020 set out a road map to substantially increase profit and achieve an operating income margin of 30% or higher in fiscal year 2020 by means of cost reduction efforts centered on reuse. While we did not meet these goals, we were able to significantly improve the profit margin. Meanwhile, in the current fiscal year, the business environment for the industry as a whole has struggled under the impact of COVID-19 and the slowdown in demand due to the extension of the deadline for removing machines conforming to previous regulations.
In the Entertainment Contents Business, under Road to 2020 we took measures to reinforce profitability in our core business and create global hit titles in growth areas. Unfortu- nately, we were unable to put out the global hit we were aiming for, but we did see a notable contribution to earnings
in the packaged games area, primarily repeat sales in Asia, Europe, and North America. Expectations for global growth in the games business are rising, backed by the ongoing worldwide expansion of game distribution platforms in recent years and the boost in stay-at-home consumption brought about by the pandemic.
In the Resort Business, over the past three years we have successfully acquired extensive expertise in preparation for our entry into the domestic integrated resort field, and have announced various business partners and steadily made other preparations. However, the impact of COVID-19 has made it necessary to make adjustments to the schedule, business plan, and other aspects of the project, and the situa- tion remains highly unpredictable.
While building on the results we achieved under Road to 2020 to target further growth, we recognize the need to con- tinue making every effort to straightforwardly identify and address issues facing the Group.
We will begin undertaking structural reforms to overcome current adversities.
We were planning to enter a new phase targeting further growth in the fiscal year ending March 2021, but with the onset of COVID-19, the Group is facing a crisis across its business
areas.
Under these conditions, we are undertaking structural
reforms in response to rapidly changing conditions and building a robust business foundation with a view toward future growth.
In November 2020, we announced several structural reform initiatives. In order to build a business structure that can adapt to current market conditions, transform to a fixed expenses level commensurate with the business structure, and secure cash flows for growth investments, we are pro- ceeding with a review of the business portfolio, streamlining of fixed expenses, and a review of non-business assets.
As a result of these initiatives, we are forecasting a net loss of ¥24.5 billion for fiscal year ending March 2021, and announced that we will pay an interim dividend of ¥10 while leaving the year-end dividend undecided.
We will revisit the year-end dividend after assessing how structural reforms are progressing and the extent to which the business has recovered in the months ahead. Although
We are working to resolve issues facing the Group as quickly as possible.
Haruki Satomi
President and Group COO (Representative Director) SEGA SAMMY HOLDINGS INC.
there is no change to our basic policy of paying stable dividends, at present we intend to carry through with structural reforms and aim for a swift turnaround in performance.
We also have to reexamine our new medium-term man- agement plan, which was due to be announced in the fiscal year ending March 2021, and would like to release it after the completion of key structural reforms.
We would like to ask our shareholders, who have entrusted us with their confidence, for their continued sup- port as we work to overcome current adversities.
See page 28 for details on structural reforms.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH

  Longer-Term Direction of the Group
Our long-term vision—as I noted at the beginning, the Mis- sion (Raison d’être) of Constantly Creating, Forever Captivat- ing —Making Life More Colorful— remains unchanged. It is my sense that, ever since this Mission was formulated, there has been a significant transformation in the awareness of the SEGA SAMMY Group as a whole.
The next step is to match our words with our actions (genkoitchi),translatingawarenessintoconcretemeasures. The distinctive corporate cultures of SAMMY and SEGA have been a wellspring of the experiences that move the heart we bring people through innovative products and services, and I believe maintaining these cultures is important. But for us to survive in the entertainment industry, which is constantly changing based on trends and tastes, each employee of the Group has to work to develop and grow, never becoming complacent with the status quo.
To this end, our immediate task is to carry through with structural reforms and build a robust business foundation that can adapt to changing conditions. Having done this, each Group company, with a shared focus on our Mission, needs to draw on its own distinctive strengths in formulating a strat- egy for the next stage of growth.
Redefining ESG and SDGs materiality for the sustainable enhancement of corporate value For the SEGA SAMMY Group, the key concept when we talk about ESG and SDGs is Constantly Creating, Forever Capti-

vating. I remain committed to the belief that entertainment has the power to give people vitality in their day-to-day lives.
Faced with a crisis of unprecedented proportions, in which the true value of entertainment companies has been called into question, we need to reconsider what we have to do in order to continue to be seen as an “essential” company.
We have redefined the materiality of the SEGA SAMMY Group to reaffirm the value of the experiences that move the hearttheGroupprovidesthrougheachofitsbusinessareas, and to guide our efforts to realize sustainable solutions to social issues and enhance corporate value. The newly defined materiality includes five categories: the environment, addiction, people, products and services, and governance.
Whenever business is conducted, it has both positive and negative impacts on society. Minimizing the negative impact, and then making an ongoing positive impact that far outweighs the negative by providing experiences that move the heart through our products and services is the underlying idea behind the Group’s ESG and SDG initiatives. SEGA SAMMY’s ultimate raison d’être as an entertainment company is to bring about a more peaceful world by acting through our core entertainment businesses to move people’s hearts and bring excitement to everyday life, and continuing to offer a sense of accomplishment, well-being, joy, peace of mind, and a variety of other emotions.

Human resource development and training and the promotion of diversity will be the foundation for dramatic growth going forward “People” is one of SEGA SAMMY’s newly defined categories of materiality. Priorities in this area are to boost job satisfac- tion and diversity and eliminate inequality, because we believe that human resources are the wellspring out of which we continue to provide people with experiences that move the heart.
Unfortunately, current business conditions require us to call for voluntary early retirement in order to transform the business structure. Going forward, though, cultivating a cul- ture in which diverse human resources can actively partici- pate and anyone with drive and determination has the chance to show their potential will continue to be a crucial issue, the key to which is human resource development.
My greatest conviction is that we ought to give every employee equal opportunities for growth. Our in-house train- ing program, SEGA SAMMY College, offers training and seminars based on different employee levels, as well as indi- vidual training programs across multiple genres. About 4,300 employees (total participants) underwent training programs in fiscal year 2020. Employees who take full advantage of these opportunities to continuously hone their skills will keep developing. On the other hand, employees who are passive and do not try to break out of their own shells cannot expect to grow in their careers. Down the road, there will always be a huge difference between what the former and the latter can achieve. Employees who grow and develop enter a kind of virtuous cycle in which their motivation increases, which in turn urges them on to even greater improvements.
In addition, we have set up a forum for mid-level and senior managers whom we hope will take over the future
The role of entertainment is to move people’s hearts and offer hope for living.

management of the Group, in which we can relate our vision of the Group’s founding principles and management philoso- phy and hold discussions. Aside from myself, the founder, CEO Hajime Satomi, and outside directors also participate in these sessions. Direct dialogue with top management enables up-and-coming mid-level managers to grasp the thinking of the current management team and, as managers, cultivate a broader perspective on our business operations.
Although investing in human resources seldom bears noticeable fruit in the short term, we will continue to aggres- sively make such investments, confident that, five or ten years down the road, this will lay down a solid foundation to carry the Group forward.
Also, because the Group is engaged in diverse business areas, ranging from pachislot and pachinko machines to entertainment contents and resorts, the human resources needed in each area are different, as are the customers each area serves. For the entire Group to strive to grow the busi- ness, the inflow of fresh new ideas is essential. I believe that by drawing on the perspectives, experiences, and opinions of diverse people, we can generate new ideas and create innova- tive products and services.
No one should ever have to miss out on an opportunity to succeed due to gender, sexuality, nationality, or any other difference. This conviction is connected with the principle of “equal opportunity” I explained earlier. Even if we do not set diversity as a formal KPI for the Group, we should be able to build up an organization that is naturally diverse if we foster a climate in which every employee is equally able to take on challenges and produce results. My ideal image of a com- pany is that diversity becomes so commonplace that it is no longer even talked about.

Sound and transparent governance
Top management constantly have to make speedy judg- ments under fast-changing business conditions. Sometimes managers can be so rushed to make a decision that they unintentionally, as it were, step down hard on the accelerator going in the wrong direction. At such times, outside directors and other officers are expected to play a critical role, that is, to act as a brake. The Group’s outside directors are made up of members with diverse experience in finance, IT, and interna- tional business, who offer critical advice and counsel from a range of perspectives and areas of specialized knowledge. I believe this is essential for the healthy functioning of the Board of Directors.
In addition, in terms of improving the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, I feel it is essential to fully understand the circumstances and context of matters brought to the Board for resolution before a decision is made. To this end, in addi- tion to creating a venue for internal and external directors to exchange opinions in advance of Board meetings, we also encourage internal and external directors to actively partici- pate in various deliberative bodies such as the Group Man- agement Strategy Committee. At such meetings, there are often lively debates between the management side and the executive side. I believe it is precisely because there are such differences of opinion that management can maintain a sense of urgency and be led on to better solutions.
In fiscal year 2019, we undertook a comprehensive review of the system of compensation for directors, with the aim of ensuring the transparency of governance and heightening incentives for directors to enhance corporate value. In par- ticular, the standard for performance-linked remuneration was significantly revised, and is now based strictly on valua- tions of ordinary income and the degree to which the man- agement plan is achieved. We will fulfill our accountability to shareholders by ensuring that our directors are committed to performance and by making their resulting compensation clearly visible.
A wellspring for delivering excitement
to customers
COVID-19 has wreaked havoc around the world. We need to recognize that this kind of cataclysmic event, so extensive that it even alters the shape of society, is not just a one-off phenomenon but that something like it is sure to reoccur at some point. To that end, looking ahead with the assumption that a pandemic or large-scale natural disaster will occur, we must build a management foundation that can ensure the sustainability of our businesses. In this regard, engagement with employees and other stakeholders is one of the things I find particularly crucial.
The Group defines stakeholders as employees, customers, business partners, shareholders and investors, and society (both in terms of social contribution and the environment)— putting top priority on employees. Naturally, in terms of put- ting into practice our stated Mission of Constantly Creating, Forever Captivating, and in terms of evaluating whether we are having a positive impact on society, the key factor is the customers who buy Group products and services and undergo the experiences. I believe the positive impact the Group has on society is precisely in the way we satisfy more customers and add color to their daily lives. And the well- spring for all of this is our employees. Our relationships with other stakeholders begin only when our employees first feel the desire to offer new products and services to the world, create them, and deliver them to customers. All the economic and social value created by the SEGA SAMMY Group springs out of the desire of employees to deliver experiences that move the heart to customers.
Continuing to be seen by society as an “essential” company.
To be “essential,” we will continue to implement sound, far-sighted measures.
In the midst of COVID-19, pachinko halls, amusement centers, resort facilities, and other public facilities had to refrain from operating for much of this year, causing the Group to face extremely difficult business conditions.
Assuming that a return to pre-COVID-19 conditions is impossible, for the Group to continue to create experiences that move the heart we have to take prompt action, imple- menting structural reforms to build a framework suited to post-COVID-19 conditions. Unfortunately, the structural reforms that are needed are painful ones. However, embracing the current adversity as an opportunity, I would like to build a robust corporate framework that can adapt
to changes in the environment and seek to create
a sustainable organization.
In recent years, as the notion of sustainable investment has taken root and spread, more importance is placed, not simply on corporate profitability, but on whether or not such investments contribute to the continual enhancement of corporate value in light of the need for social and environ- mental sustainability.
For SEGA SAMMY to continue to be seen by society as an “essential” company, we will carry out management in a way that is sincere and beyond reproach, continuing to imple- ment sound, far-sighted measures.

A Message from the CFO
Securing adequate financing to respond
to adversity
In terms of the business environment in the fiscal year ending March 2021, apart from the Consumer Games area of the Entertainment Contents Business, the Group has been facing a serious crisis due to the impact of COVID-19.
We decided to raise the borrowing limit with the idea of creating an adequate safety net for the Group. At present, working capital needed for existing businesses is around ¥70.0 billion, but, given the current environment, we estimated an additional ¥30.0 billion is required for our crisis response, resulting in around ¥100.0 billion in necessary financing.
In response to this, as of the end of September 2020, in addition to ¥143.7 billion in cash, deposits and cash equiva- lents, we have commitment lines from financial institutions, overdraft lines, and unused lines of credit totaling ¥168.0 billion. Taken altogether, we have secured a sufficient amount of liquidity, totaling ¥311.7 billion.
In addition, net cash for the same period was ¥53.5 billion, and the equity ratio remained at a high level of 62.2% despite the impact of a sharp downturn in the stock market.
Unfortunately, we were unable to achieve the financial targets set out in the Road to 2020 medium-term manage- ment plan. However, having adequate financial resources will provide us with a solid foundation from which to overcome current adversities and substantially grow the business.
Introducing ROIC management in each business area, pursuing ROE-focused management
The Road to 2020 set the operating margin and ROA as financial key performance indicators (KPIs). As the Group’s businesses expand, introducing these indicators was a step toward shifting our thinking from management focused on sheer “amounts” to management focused on “ratios,” where those in charge of each business area can be more keenly aware of the importance, not just of pursuing levels of earn- ings, but of using capital more efficiently.
For the next step, we plan to establish ROE and ordinary income as the KPIs in the next medium-term management plan currently being drawn up. We will further build share- holder value by improving ROE and ordinary income, and increasing earnings per share.
To engender a strong management focus on ROE, we will incorporate return on invested capital (ROIC) as an internal management indicator for each business area. ROIC is a KPI used to properly assess earning power. The advantage of ROIC is that it allows various businesses with differing char- acteristics to be evaluated objectively. The rate of return in terms of profit/loss depends on the particular business char- acteristics, but if we can evaluate each business using an equitable measure like ROIC, this enables us to make fair decisions about which business areas to concentrate resources on. Going forward, we will evaluate the degree to which each of our business activities has generated a return on invested capital.
For example, in a fast-growing area like Consumer Games*, after ascertaining the size and growth potential of the market, and having formulated a viable sales strategy, we need to move forward with growth investments that are likely to generate sizable returns commensurate with the amount of capital invested.
Building a robust financial foundation that can overcome adversity and realize sustainable growth for the Group
Koichi Fukazawa
Senior Executive Vice President and Group CFO (Director of the Board)

In this way, we will carry out appropriate business manage- ment making use of ROIC to help monitor the balance sheets and cash flows of each Group business activity, and manage the business portfolio in a way that maximizes earning power.
ROIC is simply an internal management tool for each business area, but if it takes root and leads to improved per- formance, we are confident that it will naturally also lead to increased ROE for the Group as a whole. Improvement of ROE can be realized by raising financial leverage, but the
appropriate leverage ratio is determined by the risk charac- teristics of a given business activity. Since the Group’s core businesses are affected by the creation of hit products, we face high business volatility, and so consider it essential to have an adequate buffer against risks. For this reason, it remains our policy to maintain a high capital adequacy ratio going forward.

Allocating funds toward growth and shareholder returns
In the recent Road to 2020 medium-term management plan, the impact of changing regulations in the Pachislot and Pachinko Machine Business and other factors prevented us from reaching our sales goals, and we fell short of our target of increasing the operating income margin to at least 30%. How- ever, through reuse initiatives and other measures, we believe we were able to fortify the earnings structure of the business.
The Entertainment Contents Business has seen some successful cases in consumer games. Compared with some of our competitors in Japan and overseas, the Group must strive to win business opportunities at a higher level, but there is no doubt that we are well-positioned to be a leading con- tender in the industry. I believe this is one of the business areas where we should focus the bulk of our management resources in order to realize strong growth going forward.
The Group has defined Value (Mindset/DNA), Mission (Raison d’être), and Vision (Ideal Self) according to a Mission Pyramid. With regard to investments, we always screen potential projects not only in terms of numerical aspects such as profitability but also in terms of whether or not, as a Group business, the project is compatible with our Mission (Raison d’être).
Regarding shareholder returns, we set the interim divi- dend for the fiscal year ending March 2021 at ¥10, and announced that the year-end dividend remains undecided. As for the year-end dividend, we intend to let our stakehold- ers know at an appropriate time while carefully assessing the progress of structural reforms and developments in business results in the second half.
There is no change to our basic policy of paying stable dividends, but at present, while net cash is under downward
pressure from COVID-19, we feel the prudent course is to steadily implement structural reforms and aim for a swift recovery in performance.
We will be investing more aggressively in growth going forward, including entry into the domestic integrated resort business, which I will touch on later. Consequently, our priority now is to enhance engagement with shareholders and investors to gain their understanding of our business strategy. We will strive to achieve greater returns, even as we take steps to manage a different set of risks than before. We would like to ask our shareholders’ support for the Group’s strategy as we pursue such returns together.
Moving forward with entry into
Integrated Resort (IR) business
The integrated resort field in Japan is poised to finally make concrete progress in and after 2021. Although it is an attempt to carry out an unprecedented national project, the Group is positioning IR as a strategic business that is critical to supporting our long-term growth.
The Group has made all the preparations needed to enter the domestic IR field: We have gained practical experience through our management of the South Korean IR facility PARADISE CITY, acquired a casino equipment sales license in Nevada, and made strides in researching the issue of gam- bling addiction. Moreover, SEGA SAMMY took part in the 1st JAPAN IR EXPO in Yokohama held at PACIFICO Yokohama in January 2020 (see page 49).
Going forward, we will enter the selection process by submitting a request for proposal (RFP) to the regional gov- ernment. The government announced its draft IR basic policy in October 2020, at the same time revising the submission period of RFPs for IR development.

The Group will continue to carefully monitor the condi- tions of entry and other feasibility factors with the aim of entering the IR business going forward.
Executing financial strategies to realize the Group’s long-term vision
COVID-19 has introduced uncertainty into all areas of corpo- rate management. So far, however, the Group has secured sufficient financing and is well positioned to withstand adver- sities and overcome the current business crisis. After the
pandemic is behind us, we will swiftly create and maintain a sturdy financial foundation, a platform from which we can support robust business growth going forward.

  Implementing structural reforms to achieve a rapid turnaround in profitability
The SEGA SAMMY Group carried out the Road to 2020 medium-term management strategy from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2020 with the aim of realizing its long-term vision. During the three-year period, reuse and other cost reduction measures in the Pachislot and Pachinko Business area resulted in improvement in the operating income margin, while sales in the Entertainment Contents Business, primarily sales of repeat titles in Asia, Europe, and the North America, grew. In the Resort Business, which is positioned to be a future driver of earnings, the Group steadily acquired the expertise needed to enter the integrated resort field in Japan.
The Group was planning to enter a new phase targeting further growth in fiscal year 2021, but the onset of COVID-19 caused a major crisis across its business areas. The Group is undertaking structural reform with a view to transforming the business structure in a way that can adapt to such changes in the environment and achieving a swift turnaround in profitability.

Outlook for Fiscal Year 2021
The Consumer Games areas is expected to continue to perform well. In addition, the exemption of Amusement Center Operations from consolidation from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 is expected to yield a much larger-than-forecast improvement in the ordinary loss, although we also expect to incur extraordinary income and extraordinary losses associated with the implementation of structural reforms. Net loss attributable to owners of parent is expected to be ¥24.5 billion.
Market environment, business conditions, etc., for fiscal year 2021
Gradual recovery is expected in both the market environment and in business conditions, although downward pressure will remain in business areas other than Consumer Games.

Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business
As an “innovator in the industry,” SEGA SAMMY will launch new initiatives and strive to generate stable profits by enhancing profitability.
External Environment
Along with the slow decline of the player population since 1995, there has been a long-term downtrend in the overall number of pachinko halls, as well as in the number of machines installed and in annual machine turnover. On the other hand, the opening of more large-scale halls and an increase in locations of major hall operators has caused a rise in the number of machines installed per store.

   Anticipated Opportunities and Risks
 Responses
Opportunities
Possibility of expanding user base
As the scope of development has expanded due to changes in regulations, machines conforming to the new regulation may expand the user base.
Phasing out of machines conforming to the previous regulation
Along with transition to machines conforming to the new regulation, the phasing out of machines conforming to the previous regulation is planned based on the
32 removal deadline.
Risks
Decline in the player population
The decline in the player population may undermine the purchasing power of hall operators and affect unit sales volume.
Risk of approval status
The approval rate*, which has remained at a low level due to the recent revision of regulations, may have a significant impact on sales.

Fiscal Year 2021 Revised Forecast
COVID-19 caused the temporary closure of pachinko halls throughout Japan. Although the hall operations have been on a recovery trend since the lifting of the country’s state of emergency, with the extension of the deadline for removing previous regulation machines, recovery of hall operators’ purchasing motivation is likely to take time. As a result, it is likely to be a rough year for manufacturers, with unit sales declining. Based on these assumptions, we anticipate a significantdecreaseinoverallsalespairedwithanordinary loss in fiscal year 2021.

Reuse and other cost reduction measures led to an improvement in profitability, lifting the operating income margin to 23% for fiscal year 2020. On the other hand, unit sales were lower than expected, reflecting a market-wide downturn in machine sales owing to the 2018 regulatory revisions, well as a significant drop in prototype approvals, which impacted sales schedules. Although the Group was able to enhance profitability in several areas, low prototype approval rates remain an issue to be resolved.

 Regulatory revisions and schedule for removal of machines conforming to the previous regulation
Pachislot and Pachinko Machines
 Overview of machines conforming to the new regulation
Although the February 2018 regulatory revision restricts the gambling aspects of Pachislot and Pachinko machines, it also enables the development of more casual, easy-to-play machines.
Since the changes, the gradual relaxation of voluntary regulations has enabled improvements in gameplay and encouraged the development of machines that can be enjoyed for a shorter time span. The Group will continue striving to create machines that incorporate innovative concepts to build up the population of future users.
Change in removal schedule of previous regulation machines due to revision
in the Entertainment Establishments Control Law and other regulations
On May 20, 2020, the National Public Safety Commission announced the transition period would be extended by a year due to revisions of enforcement regulations in the Law on Control and Improvement of Amusement and Entertainment Businesses.
In addition, following a resolution by the 21st Century Pachinko and Pachislot Industry Association, previous regulation machines will be phased out, and it is expected that the transition to the new regulations machines will be completed by December 2021.

Introduction of “Yu Time” innovative gameplay
“Yu Time” is the name of the time reduction*1 mode a machine enters when a player does not hit the jackpot up to the specified number of times during normal (low probability) play.
“Yu Time” activates under certain conditions, and only once, when the number of spins reaches between 2.5x and 3.0x the jackpot probability denominator in normal (low probability) play.
The addition of innovative gameplay features not found in previous pachinko machines has made it possible to provide users with a wide range of playing options.

Net sales: Ordinary income:

In the Amusement Machine Sales area, sales efforts centered on prize game machines and other products, but the effect of poor performance of video games and others led to overall sluggishness. Amusement Center Operations saw a downtrend in customer traffic due to Japan’s consumption tax hike and a series of typhoons as well as the impact of COVID-19.
Animation and Toys Area
Animation and Toys recorded revenues from movie distribution and video distribution, as well as from sales of new and mainstay toy products.
Review of Road to 2020
In the Packaged Games* area, higher sales were driven by the serialization of mainstay IPs and the establishment of sales frameworks in Asia, Europe, and the United States. On the other hand, the lack of hit titles in the Digital Games* area was an issue. In response, the Group is reconsidering its focus areas, reallocating resources from investments in the mobile games area to games for home video game consoles in growing Asian, European, and North American markets and the PC down- load area, and focused needed resources on global expansion. We will continue to reassess production quality and expand our multi-platform development to generate global hit titles.

Fiscal Year 2021 Revised Forecast
Following a review of the business portfolio, the Group forecasts a reduction in the loss margin due to structural reforms in the Amusement Center Operations area, as well as a significant boost in income in the Consumer Games area attributable to expanding stay-at-home consumption.
Consumer Games
    In the Packaged Games* area, the release of several large-scale new titles such as Total War: THREE KING- DOMS and MARIO & SONIC AT THE OLYMPIC GAMESTM led to a significant increase in sales, although costs were also up, reflecting in part the amortization of R&D expenses. Meanwhile, repeat sales of existing titles remained firm.
In the Digital Games* area, following the recording of impairment losses in the previous fiscal year, costs were down significantly, while profitability saw substantial improvement with the recording of one-time gains associated with the transfer of titles and offering of titles, as well as solid performance of titles in operation.

    With a new framework, SEGA will pursue opportunities in growing global markets and deliver experiences that move the heart to people.

change around the world. In particular, currently, in light of expectations of rapid growth in the market on the back of advances in 5G, cloud, and other technologies, global tech companies with deep pockets are successively getting into the market. Both the business model and the very scale of the games industry is poised to undergo a radical transformation. This year, with several new home-use hardware platforms being introduced for the first time in years, the market going forward is expected to grow significantly. Over the longer term, I think the evolution of technology can’t help but reinforce this trend.
In the midst of such drastic changes in the environment, we cannot hope to flourish in this industry if our strategy continues to focuses only on the Japanese market, which sooner or later will become increasingly tough—we’ll get left behind by the global competition. So, looking ahead to how we can grow the business over the next five, ten, twenty years, we decided to pursue opportunities in the global market by once again combining our dispersed strengths in SEGA CORPORATION. This is what led to the change in framework.
Bolstering our global framework
Previous Framework
Increase profitability, focus on domestic growth
Rapid decision-making through delegation of authority
Specialize in operation of business areas with competitive expertise Grow earnings in each business unit
Absorption merger
Trade name change
SEGA CORPORATION
   A new framework for creating global titles
In April 2020, SEGA Games Co., Ltd. and SEGA Interactive Co., Ltd. were merged and renamed SEGA CORPORATION, giving us a new framework. First of all, I would like to explain the background to this development.
Under the former framework, in the games area, the two companies mainly specialized in business operations in their respective business areas—SEGA Games in games for home video game consoles, PCs, and smartphones, and SEGA Interactive in gaming machines for amusement facili- ties. I think one advantage of such specialization is that we could strengthen the earnings structure of the Entertainment Contents Business as a whole by allowing rapid decision- making through the decisive delegation of authority, as well as reinforce our commitment to profitability.
But one downside to seeking maximum specialization was a tendency to pursue short-term results, and after a while it became difficult to take on bold new challenges. Although we were able to consistently generate a certain level of profits, I think our domestic organizations in particular became too focused on the Japanese market, as it offered fairly predictable earnings.
From a longer-term market perspective, the business environment of the games industry is undergoing dynamic
Let me say a bit more about the environment for the games industry.
Over the years, the games industry has followed a path laid out by the mainstream hardware of each era, starting from game arcades and moving to home video game consoles, to PCs, and then smartphones, and the market has continued to expand. ( Please refer to page 38)
In recent years, as I mentioned earlier, a series of global tech companies with deep pockets have entered the market, and it is expected that the battle for market dominance will intensify down the road. Barriers to gameplay experiences are going to come down even further as cloud-based gaming and subscription-based businesses, which are possible precisely because the tech companies operate large data centers around the world, take root. In the long run, as it becomes possible to target customers in emerging countries who have previously had difficulty accessing games, there will be an explosion in new users, and the gaming population is expected to keep growing.
I also sense that the trends and structure of the global games market are changing in several significant ways.
One trend is that Made in Japan content has come to be broadly accepted and is expanding globally. For example, worldwide sales of titles in the Persona and Ryu ga Gotoku (Yakuza in Western countries) series have grown to reach 1 to 3 million units over the past few years, and are highly acclaimed among overseas users. Of course, in terms of mainstream global genres, the target audience for Japa- nese games is still somewhat of a niche market—but even a niche market, when extended across a global scale, trans- lates into millions of users. I feel we have a competitive advantage in reaching diverse markets. Also, unlike in the past, with the release of titles across multiple platforms, the
platforms themselves grow and the titles can be rolled out to various regions worldwide. In addition, as digital distribu- tion becomes increasingly common, it is possible to build a long tail type of business model.
Another trend is the change in the ecosystem. Up till now, the major players in the games industry have been the plat- form providers, content publishers, and end users who play the games. However, the market is experiencing new vitality with the emergence of viewers who enjoy watching other people’s gameplay, and communicators who mainly enjoy connecting with others through gaming world venues. The other day, a well-known singer-songwriter in Japan held a virtual concert within an online game, and it was a huge hit. It was an event where you could truly sense the potential for games to become communication tools. E-sports have also become a hot topic in recent years. I see e-sports as a form of promotion that builds excitement for both users and viewers for games. I believe maximizing excitement for all members of the gaming ecosystem in this way will become a key requirement for future hits.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 PERFORMANCE & STRATEGIES

 Entertainment Contents
 Three strategies for future growth:
IP growth, user communication, global expansion
From a strategic point of view, we believe there are three key factors that will enable us to pursue even more opportunities in global markets.
The first is to increase the value of our intellectual properties (IP).
To effectively pursue opportunities in global markets, we have to develop robust IPs that appeal to global audiences. We are currently reassessing the way titles are managed, and in April 2020, established a Project Management Office to head up these efforts.
The Project Management Office is in charge of the planning and management of potential analysis and market analysis for all our IP holdings, as well as planning of title lineups across the business, resource allocation, and business design.
Until now, each of our studios has focused on delivering the best possible results with the resources at its dis- posal. As a result, the value of existing flagship IPs such as Sonic, Persona, Yakuza, and Total War, which already enjoy worldwide recognition, is increasing daily. Going forward, however, to make even greater inroads into increasingly competitive global markets, we need to enhance our IP value further. The Project Management Office will take on the role of reevaluating the potential of
Deploying the right IP on the right platforms
our IP holdings and coming up with business designs that match each IP, with a view to developing and growing the most robust IP possible.
In expanding our IP, we will pursue the development of major titles in new IP areas, as well as explore ways of increasing the value of our IP through more open collabo- ration with outside partners, not necessarily drawing only on our own resources.
For example, we expanded the Sonic IP in making Sonic the Hedgehog, which was co-produced and released with Hollywood’s long-standing cinema giant Paramount Studios—it became a huge international hit. This was a prime example of innovation brought about through the fusion of SEGA’s Sonic IP with Paramount’s production and promotion expertise. Moreover, the movie’s huge success generated renewed appreciation for SEGA’s legacy IP both within the company and without. As global markets expand, and as the entry of overseas tech companies expand the business model, numerous profit opportunities have been born out of a single IP, a single source.
The second important factor for future growth is user communication.
As I mentioned earlier, in order to grow robust, popular IPs, it will be even more important in the future to build long-term
relationships through continuous, close communication with the users who are the biggest fans of SEGA’s IP.
On the flip side, if we disappoint user expectations, we risk harming the value of the IP itself. We will work to improve user satisfaction by allowing developers to engage more fully with users, and by incorporating feedback gained from interactions with users in development of titles and opera- tion of services.
SEGA has spent years cultivating experience and exper- tise in sharing excitement with such users, not only through our home video games, PC games, and games for smart- phones, but also in the Amusement businesses. We want to incorporate this expertise and leveraging of human resources into the development of new game titles and operation of services.
We believe that accurately grasping user expectations, continuing to surpass them, and continuing to provide high-quality content will lead to success in a global context.
The third factor for growth is global expansion.
Our bases in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and other parts of the world are indispensable for expanding SEGA’s IP globally.
The games market is expanding worldwide, and people of various nationalities, generations, and genders are encountering games. As creators, we cannot meet the needs of such diverse users unless we ourselves are also a diverse organization.
SEGA has traditionally had a deep-seated culture of being open and accepting of different ideas and new values without discriminating. One of the advantages SEGA has in reaching into global markets is that our various studios in different parts of the world can each contribute to building a diverse title portfolio by drawing on their unique strengths in developing titles.
In addition, Sega’s localization capabilities are one of the reasons why the Persona and Yakuza series, which I mentioned earlier, have been so well received internationally. SEGA’s base in North America has the strongest connection to English-speaking users, is familiar with the market, and has a large number of staff with a solid understanding of Japanese culture. While respecting the unique worldview of Japanese games, they have improved the quality of the games by localizing the titles to best fit user preferences in the various regions. I am personally proud that they are the best team capable of expanding titles created in Japan to global markets.

 Project Management Office
     Market analysis
Revisiting IP characteristics Organizing the IP lineup Resource allocation
Business design / negotiations

    Global partnerships
  Last but not least, we have cultivated a corporate culture of boldly taking on the challenge of innovation without fear of failure. We are now entering the stage of establishing SEGA’s strong presence in hotly contested global markets.
Working styles are changing on a global level due to social shifts and the recent pandemic, and we are establishing new styles of communication with overseas bases and business partners. We believe it will be possible to carry forward business design, build partnerships, and expand business development online at speeds that were unheard of in the past, without having to be physically on site.
In the process of taking on new challenges, there may be times when we run into walls or experience setbacks that
we didn’t have to face in the past. Even so, we will continue to have confidence in our well-honed sense of what is interesting and engaging, and then strive to make what we create provide a sense of affinity to people.
The SEGA Group celebrated its 60th anniversary in June 2020. From the beginning of the company, we have overcome many challenges to get to where we are now. Our path going forward is sure not to be easy, but at the same time, the possibilities are endless. And ten years down the road, on our 70th anniversary, I hope to show all of our stakeholders a world where SEGA games and services are loved even more widely than they are now.

Achievements for Fiscal Year 2020
Phoenix Seagaia Resort took various measures, such as offering special accommodation packages and hosting other 25th anniversary events, to attract customers, mainly from the Kyushu region. Nevertheless, the number of customers dropped off sharply in March due largely to the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in a full-year visitor increase of only 3.3%. Meanwhile, investments towards the Group’s entry into the domestic integrated resort business increased.
Overseas, promotional campaigns primarily targeting Japanese VIP customers yielded higher visitor traffic to PARADISE CITY, South Korea’s first IR. Through this facility SEGA SAMMY is also gaining valuable developmental and operational know-how towards its entry into the integrated resort business in Japan.

Concerning Entry into the Domestic IR business
COVID-19 has caused delays in the process of selecting an operator to enter the Integrated Resort (IR) business in Japan. The Japanese government published its draft IR basic policy in October 2020, at the same time revising the submission period of requests for proposal (RFPs) for IR development.
The Group will continue to carefully monitor the conditions of entry and other factors with the aim of entering the IR business going forward.

  Through the operation of resort facilities in Japan and overseas, the Group has been working to accumulate development and operation expertise in preparation for entering the Integrated Resort(IR) business in Japan. The accumulation of expertise is proceeding further with the recent steps include the acquisition of a gaming equipment sales license in Nevada, collaborative research with Kyoto University on gambling addiction, and announcement of several business alliances at the JAPAN IR EXPO held in Yokohama.
Roughly 45 companies, including major overseas gaming operators, hoping to win
operating rights at the Yamashita Wharf integrated resort, engaged in the trade
exhibition. The goal of the exhibition was to advance Japan’s burgeoning Integrated
Resort (IR) industry. As a prospective IR operator, SEGA SAMMY’s active involvement
in the exhibition included producing a dynamic booth, as well as Group COO Haruki
Satomi giving an operator keynote address. In the address, he conveyed SEGA
SAMMY as the viable candidate, guided by the concept of “an IR that can sustainably
succeed.” SEGA SAMMY’s success will prosper alongside local communities,
citizens, and businesses, while generating interest in the entire region and launching
Yokohama as a “stay destination” for international tourists. From facility development
to operations, drawing on the know-how gained from PARADISE CITY and its various
business units, SEGA SAMMY, as a Japanese firm, is positioned to actualize a uniquely Japanese IR that can offer groundbreaking, experiences that move the heart to visitors from around the world.

  SEGA SAMMY HOLDINGS
INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 FOUNDATION

The SEGA SAMMY Group is working to reduce environmental impact while also improving profitability in its mainstay Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business.
To increase the reusability of components in pachislot and pachinko machines, we are working to standardize parts, boards and units, starting at the design and development stage. In 2016, we set a target for the number of reusable components, which was achieved in fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, we increased the efficiency and quality of reuse activities by switching from smaller components to single units for some parts used in pachinko boards and pachislot LCD screens and reels.
Also, from an environmental standpoint, we increased the recovery rate for used pachislot and pachinko machines to 93% in fiscal year 2020 by adjusting trade-in criteria and buying back used machines.
Meanwhile, we continue to work on reducing the environmental impact of the amusement machine industry in general by cooper- ating with other manufacturers to create shared component and unit platforms.

The SEGA SAMMY Group is pursuing optimization in all areas of the pachinko and pachislot machine value chain, including development, manufacturing, and sales. Through these efforts, we aim to reduce environmental impact by cutting back on component use while also promot- ing the reuse of components, which is supporting an improvement in business profitability.
We are improving the efficiency of reuse activities by expanding the range of reused components and increasing the ratio of standardized parts and materials.

At the design and development stages, we are promoting common components, increasing the range of components that are reused, and designing products with reuse in mind.
Production
At the production stage, previously dispersed component warehouse func- tions are being consolidated at the site of the neighboring Kawagoe Factory in order to facilitate efficient component recycling and reuse.
We sell pachinko machine boards designed to help reduce investments when introducing new machines in order to strengthen relationships with pachinko halls and establish a cycle of reuse and recycling.
The Group seeks to ensure proper disposal of used pachinko and pachislot machines that have reached the end of their lives of bringing joy to customers. We therefore promote recycling by offering trade-in programs with regard to our own machines and by utilizing an industry association collection system. We also participate in the used pachinko and pachislot machine collection system developed by industry associations to implement more advanced recycling measures (reduction of weight and appropriate treatment).

Discussions regarding addiction countermeasures began when the Society for Research on Pachinko Addiction was formed in 2003. The Recovery Support Network (RSN) was established with support from industry groups in 2006 and conducts wide-ranging problem-solving initiatives such as public outreach and tele- phone counseling.
In December 2018, the Advisory Council on Addiction Counter- measures in the Pachinko and Pachislot Industry was established as a third-party body to evaluate and provide advice on addiction countermeasures, giving the industry access to objective opinions on the issue. Efforts to tackle addiction accelerated in December 2019 with the release of the Basic Guidelines for Addressing Pachinko Addiction and the Basic Guidelines for the Pachinko and Pachislot Industry for Addressing Addiction, which set out policies and specific measures to address addiction. By taking a leading role in these efforts, the SEGA SAMMY Group is contributing to the sound development of the industry.

In May 2019, the World Health Assembly of the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized excessive playing of online games and home video games as a new mental disease, referred to as “gaming disorder.”
In Japan, four game-related bodies (CESA, JOGA, MCF, and JeSU) have established a joint investigative commission, which has tasked impartial outside experts to conduct research into effective countermeasures based on scientific studies. In September 2020, the team of experts began investigative research into gaming disor- der, starting with a benchmarking study to look at appropriate mea- surement criteria and the characteristics of the disorder to support further research, such as understanding the scale of excessive gaming, its causes and protective factors.
Taking into consideration the issue of excessive game playing and micro-transactions by minors through the Gacha system, which can result in a strong gambling-like experience and high payments, the Entertainment Contents Business is taking measures to prevent excessive payments, such as setting upper limits on monthly micro-transaction payments for certain titles based on age certifica- tion, establishing internal guidelines that conform with guidelines stipulated by the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association, an industry body, and avoiding the use of ambiguous phrasing that can lead to excessive expectations.

SEGA SAMMY Group has teamed up with Kyoto University, a national university, to conduct joint research into the processes of gambling addiction* by collating and analyzing data on the progres- sion of gambling behaviors.
This research aims to identify the precursors of dangerous levels of gambling by gathering and analyzing data from players at overseas casinos, including Japanese players. Drawing on the results of this research, we aim to establish a system that rapidly detects players that are exhibiting signs of addiction and that pre- vents their behavior from escalating.
In research published so far, data analysis has demonstrated the effect of win-lose perceptions on gambling behavior. We con- tinue to work with Kyoto University on research into identifying the signs of addiction.

Innovation in the SEGA SAMMY Group is derived from the diverse values and capabilities of its human resources. We are implementing systems and creating environments where diverse people can fulfill their potential, and promoting diversity to establish a corporate culture steeped in creativity.

We are promoting better work-life balance to improve employee motivation. In addition to a flextime system that recognizes different workstyles, we have introduced the Job Plus (JOB+) system that allows certain employees to take side jobs. We also offer a telework system that gives employees the option to work outside the office, and we run an onsite SEGA SAMMY Soramori Nursery School for employees with young children. With these systems and options, we have created an environment where our people can work with peace of mind. We are also stepping up activities that promote diversity to ensure the Group’s diverse human resources can fulfill their potential. Specifically, we run seminars and training courses to raise diversity awareness, provide job opportunities to people with disabilities via special subsidiaries, support activities that increase awareness of the LGBT community, and implement measures to promote career opportunities for women.
In human resources development, we are working to raise the skill levels of our employees through the SEGA SAMMY College, a Groupwide training organization that cultivates business leaders imbued with the Group’s corporate culture and that instills basic principles in our employees.

Since relocating the head office, we have been actively encouraging networking between SEGA CORPORATION and other Group companies.
SEGA runs the technology-focused SEGA Developer Conference, the Arcade Department holds GITEN, an internal research conference on fundamental technologies, and we run various other workshops to share knowledge on AI and automa- tion, as well as the SEGA GAME JAM. Our goal is to harness the combined capabilities of the whole SEGA SAMMY Group by actively encouraging inter- action between personnel in Group companies.

In the Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business, we offer safe, high-quality products and services by actively implementing inventive and effective quality improvement measures. We also take the following actions to eliminate major failures that could compromise safety.

The Revised Amusement Businesses Law Enforcement Ordinance, in effect since July 2004, is primarily intended to control excessive gambling on amusement machines and prevent improper modifica- tions. Adhering to this ordinance, the Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business has established a special group to collect market information and build amusement machines that are resis- tant to abuse in order to prevent users from illegally manipulating the machines for illicit benefit. To combat improper modifications, which are becoming increasingly complex, we monitor and manage the distribution of our amusement machines to completely eradicate from the market any machines that have been illegally modified.
Suspicious solicitations for “sakura/uchiko” by people posing as SEGA Sammy Group recruiters, as well as groundless walkthroughs and strategy guides have been circulating in some areas of the market. In response, we are implementing various countermeasures and encouraging caution via the Sammy website and pamphlets.

In the Consumer Games area of the Entertainment Contents Business, we established the Project Management Office in April 2020 to lead the development of high-quality content for overseas users to support the Group’s growth in the global market. The office is tasked with evaluating the potential of the Group’s intellectual property (IP) and analyzing markets. It will also manage the title lineup for the business as a whole, allocate resources and conduct corporate planning such as business design to support the development of SEGA SAMMY content worldwide.

In the Entertainment Contents Business, we label product packag- ing, user manuals and other tools for home video game software in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations, industry group guidelines and internal rules. By applying clear and appropriate labels, we ensure that customers can use our products and services with confidence.
We also clearly specify the range of users for each product and actively address any ethical concerns. We label all our products in line with assessments conducted in countries around the world. In Japan, we indicate the target age group for each game based on the CERO* ratings system and label products in accordance with our own voluntary standards. Drawing on expertise accumulated through the CERO rating system and previous cases, we have formulated guidelines that cover 9 categories and 26 items.

ESG Risks and Countermeasures in the Value Chain

Before they can be sold, pachislot and pachinko machines must receive approval through prototype testing, which determines whether machines are compliant with the Entertainment Establishments Control Law and other statutory laws and regulations. Therefore, regulatory revision can significantly affect the marketability and unit sales of pachis- lot and pachinko machines.
Response We are taking steps to increase efficiency with the aim of accelerating develop- ment so that we can swiftly respond to regula- tory revision. In addition, we have to address the risk of a potential drop in the ratio of products receiving approval through prototype testing while also developing models with diverse gameplay that a wide range of customers can enjoy casually. Our goal is to improve the quality of our products, in parallel with efforts to rapidly address changes to regulations.
Sammy’s manufacturing processes could give rise to surplus electrical components and other components. We use natural resources, such as wood, and materials that could place a burden on the environment, such as adhesives. Also, processing pachinko and pachislot machines at the end of their service lives is an important responsibility.
Response We are committed to the “3Rs” (reduce, reuse and recycle) throughout all our business processes. At the design and devel- opment stages, we are working to standardize parts and share parts between pachislot and pachinko machines, and we reuse machines removed from pachinko halls. We are promot- ing the use of water-based adhesives with less environmental impact.
Our reuse initiatives are aimed at mitigating environmental impact, but a parallel objective is to improve the profitability of our businesses by increasing efficiency through the use of common parts to reduce procurement costs.
There are concerns that growing public criti- cism about pachinko and pachislot addiction and the use of improperly modified pachinko and pachislot machines in commercial opera- tions or improper playing techniques could harm the image of the pachinko and pachislot industry, ultimately leading to a contraction in the pachinko and pachislot machine market.
Response To support the sustainable development of our industry, we are actively working with industry bodies to control addic- tive behavior. We also provide backing for recovery support networks and are developing machines with more casual gameplay. In terms of efforts to prevent improper modifications, we coordinate with industry associations in a volun- tary drive to collect pachinko and pachislot machines that have been improperly modified. In addition, we have established an office tasked with preventing illegal acts, which gathers market information and contributes to the manu- facture of pachinko and pachislot machines that are highly resistant to improper modification. We also take measures to urge caution in relation to strategy guides that are unfounded.

Lack of responsiveness to social demands for measures against gambling addiction could invite public backlash and jeopardize business continuity.

 Corporate Governance
Basic Principles Regarding Corporate Governance
The SEGA SAMMY Group positions corporate governance as the most important foundation for facilitating good corporate behavior. The Group has the aim of “improving efficiency,” “securing soundness” and “enhancing transparency” of corporate management as its “basic policy for corporate governance”; based on which the Group has made determinations on important management issues, including appointment of director candidates, determination of directors’ compensation, oversight of management, and determination of auditors’ compensation.
General Meeting of Shareholders
To encourage active participation in the General Meeting of Shareholders and facilitate the exercise of voting rights, SEGA SAMMY HOLDINGS sends out early convocation notices (three weeks before the meeting) to provide shareholders with sufficient time to consider the Company’s proposals. The Company has also introduced an electronic voting system that allows shareholders to exercise their voting rights using the inter- net and other electronic methods.
Corporate Governance System
The SEGA SAMMY Group has adopted an Audit and Supervisory Board member system to enable directors to make prompt, optimal deci- sions amid volatile business conditions, based on their wealth of expertise and experience regarding the industry, market trends, products, merchandise, and services. At the same time, we have appointed external directors and strengthened our executive officer system and internal auditing system, thereby reinforcing corporate governance with respect to operational management and oversight. In addition, starting from January 2010, the Company has selected two external Audit & Supervisory Board members as independent directors from the perspective of protecting the interests of ordinary shareholders, in order to further enhance management transparency.

What is your policy on strategic shareholdings?
Strategic shareholdings are limited to cases that are deemed to provide benefits to all shareholders by increasing corporate value.
The Company holds shares for purposes other than pure investment only in cases where the Company considers that holding the shares will enable a busi- ness alliance, the expansion of transactions, etc., and will lead to an improvement in corporate value, thereby benefitting shareholders.
The Company examines the economic rationale, future outlook, etc., for holding the shares on a periodic basis at its Board of Directors meetings, and discusses whether or not it is beneficial to retain the shares.
In general, the Company exercises voting rights of such shares on all proposals based on whether or not
What internal control systems related to financial A reporting are you creating and maintaining?
We have put in place evaluation and reporting mechanisms that ensure reliable financial reporting.
The Group started the Group Internal Control project during fiscal year 2006, established a scheme for evaluating and reporting of the internal control system required for corporate groups under the system of “Evaluation and Auditing of Internal Control Relating to Financial Reporting” (the Japanese Version of the “SOX Act”) as stipulated in the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, and remedied inadequacies dis- covered in the course of conducting the evaluation. As a result, efforts for ensuring trust/reliability in financial
office, directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members are continuously provided with further opportunities to acquire and enhance necessary or new knowledge, including participating in training sessions provided by external lecturers such as attorneys and experts in each area, for example, after the conclusion of a Board of Directors meeting.
In addition, the Company encourages each director and Audit & Supervisory Board member to voluntarily improve their skills by participating in external seminars and lectures sponsored by organizations to which the Company belongs, and provides support in paying the necessary expenses.
adopting such proposals will contribute to the sustain- able growth and medium- to long-term corporate value enhancement of both the Company and the investee.

 Q What policies and reasons support the selection of external directors and external
A Audit & Supervisory Board members?
The Company selects external directors from
among managers, etc., who are expected to
(i) provide advice on how to enhance the corporate value of the SEGA SAMMY Group from external perspectives, and (ii) provide oversight functions over the execution of duties by external directors, based on their deep insight and extensive experience.
The Company has eight directors, three of whom are external directors and two of whom are independent directors*1, as well as four Audit & Supervisory Board members, two of whom are external Audit & Supervisory Board members and independent directors. At the various meetings that they attend, external directors and external Audit & Supervisory Board members provide guidance and advice based on their abun- dant experience and highly specialized knowledge.
Selection Policy
The Company selects external directors from among managers, etc., who are expected to (i) provide advice on how to enhance the corporate value of the SEGA SAMMY Group from external perspectives, and (ii) pro- vide oversight functions over the execution of duties by external directors, based on their deep insight and extensive experience. The Company understands that external Audit & Supervisory Board members play an important role in realizing a corporate governance system which improves the neutrality and indepen- dence of the auditing system, and thus, selects exter- nal Audit & Supervisory Board members who have significant expertise and experience in a wide range of fields, and from whom it is expected that the sound-
64 ness of the management can be secured by conduct- ing auditing from a neutral and objective standpoint.
Q
Principles Regarding Independence
The Company determines the independence of external directors and external Audit and Supervisory Board members based on criteria such as “significant business partners” and “large monetary amounts,” which are cited in the independence criteria stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), with reference to the publicly announced standard model for appoint- ing independent directors and based on said criteria. We deem that persons satisfying the requirements of said criteria do not have conflicts of interest with general shareholders.

Q What steps you are taking to assess the A effectiveness of the Board of Directors?
The Company aims to further improve the effective- ness of the Board of Directors by enhancing the Board’s capabilities.
The Independent Advisory Committee analyzes and assesses the Board of Directors as a whole with respect to its size, composition, management meth- ods, deliberations, and support systems, as well as other matters that are important for the effective per- formance of roles and duties by the Board of Directors.
In fiscal year 2020, each director responded to a questionnaire. Based on the responses, the Indepen- dent Advisory Committee conducted an assessment
and reported that the effectiveness of the Company’s Board of Directors was being maintained at an ordinary Board of Directors’ meeting. The Independent Advisory Committee favorably evaluated measures to encourage in-depth discussions of matters, which included creating opportunities to discuss important matters in advance of Board of Directors’ meetings. At the same time, the Committee recommended that (a) thorough feed- back be provided with regard to remarks and opinions provided during advance discussions and that (b) explanations of matters already explained prior to Board of Directors’ meetings be streamlined to ensure adequate time for deliberation in order to ensure effective management. In light of this effectiveness assessment, the Board of Directors will improve its functions and effectiveness.

     Q
Please tell us about the Company’s dialogue with shareholders and other investors.
The Company actively discloses information to help all investors make informed investment decisions.
The Company has defined its basic stance toward information disclosure described in its Investor Relations Policy.

In addition to information disclosure mandated by laws or the abovementioned timely
disclosure regulations, the Company also conducts proactive voluntary disclosure of information with the potential to significantly influence the decisions of investors.
For institutional investors and analysts, the Com- pany continues to hold results briefings and meetings using telephone and web conferencing systems, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to maintain ongoing levels of dialogue.

Since there is a possibility that the management of the corporate pension funds affects the stable asset buildups of employees and the corporate finances of the SEGA SAMMY Group, the corporate pension division has experts with the necessary experience and qualities for asset management.
In addition, the corporate pension funds are man- aged under an appropriate system, such as monitoring the state of asset management through regular invest- ment reports made by the fund management agencies.

First of all, let me say I only agreed to take on the external director role because I had sufficient time resources. I attend not only Board meetings but also Group Management Strat- egies Committee meetings, where the executives are gath- ered and take part in extended discussions. Also, while of course it is necessary to spend sufficient time for managing, I think substance is even more important than length of time. In that sense, I’m very proud that my experience can be put to good use in the Group’s business areas. While holding a posi- tion at NTT docomo, I was also on the board of joint ventures with other companies, including Dentsu, Sony, and McDonald’s. At one point, I was serving on nearly 10 boards at the same time. Even then, in terms of my criteria for whether or not to accept an offer, I decided I wouldn’t agree to join the board of a company that had no connection to my previous work or experience, and where I couldn’t make a contribution or provide appropriate advice. In that respect, I’m confident that the Group’s business areas can benefit from my prior knowledge as well as my ability as an active CEO to be in touch with the times.

Q
Please tell us about the Company’s role as an asset owner of corporate pension funds.
The Company continuously strengthens related teams and organizations to ensure appropriate asset management.
In order to ensure that pensions and other benefits are provided in the future, the Company and some of its consolidated subsidiaries have established a founda- tion and set forth rules and regulations, and have man- aged the pension funds in accordance with the rules and regulations.
Managers at many companies, including ours, have dramatically changed how they think about work, and my sense is that this crisis will undoubtedly speed up efforts to reform working styles in Japan. The challenge down the road is to revise how we do employee performance evaluations in line with the new working styles. In other words, we have to build systems that can evaluate work by output. But this can’t be done overnight. Middle managers in particular are often under pressure to develop and carry out new evaluation processes, which can be a cause of great distress. To alleviate such distress, it is the role of top management to take initiative in supporting new processes and following up as needed. Just as the productivity of Japanese companies hasn’t improved significantly in 20 years, performance evaluation systems have also changed very little. With the impact of COVID-19, companies that are able to reform their performance evaluation processes and those that aren’t are sure to show a big difference in growth potential after 5 or 10 years.

Generally, I think it’s better to some extent for outside directors to hold positions on multiple boards, so that they don’t depend on one company alone. I currently serve on the boards of several companies, so I’m not financially depen- dent on any of them. I’m always prepared to step down, and from time to time I share tough opinions with the executives. Outside directors who don’t serve on multiple boards inevita- bly want to keep their position. I think it’s more healthy, in fact, to serve on up to about five boards at the same time.
In the midst of a drastically changing world, building a forceful corporate presence, surmounting adversities, and further honing our unique strengths.

The most critical issue in the medium to long term is getting the Integrated Resort (IR) business up and running. In terms of becoming an IR operator in Japan, it is my view that SEGA SAMMY has already gained the necessary expertise in vari- ous areas and is prepared well enough internally for what needs to be done. Down the road, however, the situation can totally change due to the influence of government policy and other external factors. We have to be vigilant and ready to take measures when needed.
Another thing is the earnings structure, where the bulk of Group profits still come from the Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business segment, which is subject to factors in the operating environment such as public image and regula- tion. How the Group can reduce its overdependence on that segment and build profit drivers in other areas will be an important management issue going forward.
Finally, there’s the issue of further growing the Consumer Games area. Currently, despite the fact that the SEGA brand has a high level of global recognition, the Group hasn’t been able to fully translate this into better performance compared to industry competitors. COVID-19 has actually been a boon for the overall game sector. I think the Group can use this as an opportunity to set its sights even higher. I also have high expectations for the development capabilities of the over- seas studios the Group has acquired.
Going forward, the key will be how well the Group can win over users in the online area and how much new intellectual property it can put out. I’ve spoken with the COO, Haruki Satomi, about this as well, but I think it’s time for an overhaul of
the whole way of doing game development. SEGA is a com- pany with a long history and has many excellent, veteran developers. However, precisely because for that reason, it can be hard to raise up young star developers with new ideas. If you look at other companies, rookie developers are creat- ing global hits. I think there’s an urgent need to give greater opportunities to new developers, and foster a climate in which they can flourish. Now is the time to do this, while the Group’s finances are sound and there’s room to take on vari- ous new challenges.
subsidiaries. He has constantly been aware of the need to strengthen global alliances with an eye toward overseas growth. He has also been deeply involved as an executive in the planning and execution of SEGA’s online strategies, an area where the company has tended to lag behind. Now, in top management, I think Satomi should use that same resolve to drive change in areas where he senses things are “not right,” and pursue his vision of what the company ought to be.
The CEO, Hajime Satomi, excels at the technique of draw- ing people in and gaining their support for projects he wants to carry forward. That kind of management style and human networking capability really stand out among Japanese com- panies. On the other hand, the management approach of COO Satomi draws on both logic and a sense of how things work on the ground. This management style is much needed in online business areas and overseas activities. I have high hopes that COO Satomi’s abilities and his personality will equip him to pursue global growth and address the chal- lenges facing the entire Group.
stands now?
I personally think the Group is in a very good place. CEO Satomi was quite optimistic from the start, but looking at things from the outside, to me there seemed to be an obvious gap in track records compared with the overseas mega-operators, and I was worried whether things would work out. At the moment, however, I think the Group has steadily gained experience to close that gap, and has even reached the point where the Japanese government has signaled its willingness to consider domestic companies as candidates. That’s a really solid achievement.
I think a major factor behind this was the decision to take on the challenge of operating PARADISE CITY, South Korea’s first IR facility. Even after it opened, amid souring Japan-Korea relations and other less-than-favorable busi- ness conditions, the Group continues to manage the resort very effectively, and operations on the casino side are doing particularly well. In addition, I think the bold decision from the beginning to send over nearly 50 employees to acquire expertise is the reason SEGA SAMMY has become a front- runner among Japanese IR candidates. There have been various hurdles over the past few years, and at times I’ve been concerned, but the Group’s efforts have steadily begun to bear fruit. The proposed Japanese IR is a national project, which is affected by many external factors including the impact of the COVID-19, but if the project goes ahead as planned, I am positive that SEGA SAMMY will be able to demonstrate its full potential.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income
Long-Term Trends
The principal factors causing the decline in net sales are a decrease in the revenues of the Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business due to the tightening of regulations and a decrease in sales accompanying a reduction in business scale, which resulted from the structural reform of the existing businesses of SEGA Games (including the closure and disposal of amusement centers in the Amusement Center Operations area). Regarding earnings, structural reforms in fiscal year 2015 improved the profitability of the Entertainment Contents Business, which con- tributed to earnings and enabled the Company to depart from a downward earnings trend. Although the Digital Games area continues to see intensifying competition, the operating income margin of the Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business has improved significantly.

Consolidated Financial Position
Long-Term Trends
In fiscal year 2011, total assets—which had been decreasing as a consequence of a reduction in the business scale of the Amuse- ment Center Operations area and a valuation loss on securities and sales of securities—began trending upward due to an increase in goodwill accompanying acquisitions in the Entertainment Contents Business, the Group’s initiatives in preparation for participation in the Integrated Resort (IR) business, and an increase in investment securities accompanying new investment in growth areas. In recent years, however, total assets have again been trending downward, reflecting a decrease in cash and deposits accompanying reloca- tion of the head office, a decrease in securities, and the redemption of bonds. The equity ratio has remained consistently around 60% due to a policy of securing a certain level of internal reserves that enable investment in growth areas, the payment of stable cash dividends and ensuring financial soundness in consideration of future participation in the domestic IR business, even amid the earnings volatility stemming from the presence or absence of hit products, which is the nature of the Group’s businesses.
Total Assets and Equity Ratio
Consolidated Cash Flows
Long-Term Trends
With the exception of certain fiscal periods, the Group has contin- ued to record net cash outflows in investing activities due to M&As in growth areas and strategic investments to raise production capacity. Since fiscal year 2011, the Group has been investing in organizational restructuring. These efforts included investments to make three listed subsidiaries into wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, the Group is investing actively in such growth areas as the Integrated Resort (IR) business and the Digital Games area. Through a cash management system, the Group uses internal capital efficiently. Also, the Group uses a range of methods to support liquidity and meet investment needs flexibly, including borrowings and bond issuance.
Fiscal Year 2020 Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal year 2020 amounted to ¥158,617 million, up ¥10,552 million from the previous fiscal year-end.

Consolidated Employee Numbers
At the end of fiscal year 2020, the consolidated number of employees was 8,798, up 805 from the previous fiscal year-end. This rise was mainly due to an increase in overseas development personnel in line with the strengthening of global human resources in the Entertainment Contents Business area (approximately 210 employees) and the conversion of fixed-term to permanent labor contracts (approximately 440 employees).

Recognition of R&D Expenses and Content Production Expenses by Product and Service
The Group undertakes stable, long-term investment in R&D and content production with the aim of creating and strengthening IPs—which are a source of the Group’s competitiveness—and continuously generating earnings. The method and timing of expense recognition differs based on development lead times and product lifecycles.
Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business and casino machines of the Amusement Machine Sales area
Expenses are recognized as they arise (process outsourcing expenses recognized when work is inspected).
Digital Games area
Expenses are recognized in intangible assets during the development period, and the basic straight-line amortization period is 24 months from the month of service commencement. (The amortization period differs depending on the title. Titles with long lifecycles can have amortization periods of more than 36 months.)
Amusement Machine Sales area (excluding casino machines)
Expenses are recognized as work in process during development and as expenses linked to unit sales after launch.
Packaged Games area
Expenses are recognized as work in process during development and as expenses after launch. However, there are different methods of treating expenses after launch.
Expenses are recognized three months after release as expenses linked to unit sales.
For some titles, certain expenses are recognized three months after release as expenses linked to unit sales, and the remaining expenses are amortized over a period of 21 months.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of SEGA SAMMY HOLDINGS INC. (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements from International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).
The accounts of the Company’s overseas subsidiaries are based on their accounting records maintained in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles prevailing in the respective countries of domicile. However, necessary adjustments are made upon con- solidation for 2019 and 2020. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restructured and translated into English (with certain expanded disclosure) from the consolidated
financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. Certain supplementary information included in the statutory Japanese-language consolidated financial statements is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Each amount of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is rounded down to the nearest one million yen.
In preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications have been made in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2019 consolidated financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2020. These changes had no impact on previously reported results of operations or shareholders’ equity.

                            2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
                                                            90
1. Scope of consolidation
(1) Number of consolidated subsidiaries: 68
From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the following companies were included in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries: Two Point Studios Ltd. and one other company, because of their acquisition of shares; DARTSLIVE MALAYSIA SDN. BHD., because of an increase in its materiality.
From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the following companies have been excluded from the scope of consolidation: JMS-United Co., Ltd. and four other companies, because of the transfer of their shares.
(2) Number of non-consolidated subsidiaries: 16
Non-consolidated subsidiaries are excluded from the scope of consolidation because the combined amount of each of assets, net sales and net income corresponding to the percentage of equity interest held by the Company, and the combined amount of retained earnings corresponding to the percentage of equity interest held by the Company, do not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements.
2. Application of the equity method
(1) Number of non-consolidated subsidiaries accounted for under the equity method: 6
(2) Number of affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method: 11
(3) Number of non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies which are not accounted for under the equity method: 11
Some of the Company’s non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are not accounted for under the equity method because the com- bined amount of net income corresponding to the percentage of
equity interest held by the Company, and the combined amount of retained earnings corresponding to the percentage of equity interest held by the Company do not have a significant effect on the consoli- dated financial statements even if they are excluded from the scope of equity method, and have no significance as a whole.
3. Accounting policies
(1) Valuation and accounting treatment for important assets
1) Held-to-maturity debt securities
Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost method (the straight-line method)
2) Available-for-sale securities
Securities with fair market value:
Securities with fair market value are stated at fair market value. The difference between acquisition cost and market value is accounted for as valuation difference on available-for-sale securities in net assets, with cost of sales determined by the moving-average method.
With respect to compound financial instruments whose fair values cannot be categorized and measured for each embedded derivative, the entire compound financial instruments are appraised by fair value, and unrealized gains or losses are reported as income or expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
Securities without quoted market prices:
Securities without quoted market prices are carried at cost, which is determined by the moving-average method.
The net amount of equity included in the Company’s financial statements from limited liability investment partnerships and similar investments, regarded as marketable securities under Article 2-2 of the Financial Investment and Exchange Law of Japan, is calculated based on the relevant financial statements for the partnership available as of the reporting date stipulated in the partnership agreement.
3) Derivatives
Derivatives are stated at fair market value.

INTEGRATED REPORT 2020 FINANCIALS

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
4) Inventories
Inventories are stated at cost, cost being determined mainly by the gross-average method (or at the net realizable value (NRV) calculated by writing down the book value to reflect a decrease in the NRV).
Work in process is also stated at cost, cost being determined by the specific identification method (or at the NRV calculated by writing down the book value to reflect a decrease in the NRV).
(2) Depreciation and amortization for important assets
1) Property, plant and equipment (excluding lease assets) Depreciation is calculated primarily using the straight-line method. Range of useful life for the assets is as follows:
Buildings and structures: 2–50 years
Machinery, equipment and vehicles: 2–15 years
Amusement machines and facilities: 2–5 years
2) Intangible assets (excluding lease assets)
Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method. The software used in the Company is amortized by the straight-line method based on the useful lives within the Company (less than 5 years).
3) Lease assets
Finance leases which transfer ownership:
Depreciation method for such assets is the same as that which applies to property, plant and equipment owned by the Company. Finance leases which do not transfer ownership:
Depreciated by using the straight-line method assuming the useful life equals to the lease period with a residual value of zero.
4) Right-of-use assets
The lease period or the useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter, is used as the useful life, and the residual value is calculated as zero.
(3) Accounting for deferred assets
Bond issue cost: All expenses are expensed when incurred.
(4) Accounting for allowances and provisions
1) Allowance for doubtful accounts
Allowance for doubtful accounts is provided in the amount sufficient to cover possible losses based on a historical write-off of general receivables.
Receivables with default possibility and bankrupt receivables are calculated based on an individual assessment of the possibility
of collection.
2) Provision for bonuses
The estimated amount of bonuses was recorded to meet the payment of employee bonuses, an amount corresponding to the current fiscal year.
3) Provision for directors’ bonuses
The estimated amount of bonuses was recorded to meet the payment of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members’ bonuses,
an amount corresponding to the current fiscal year.
4) Provision for point card certificates
In order to provide for the usage of points granted to customers under the point system, the estimated future usage amount for the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 has been recorded.
5) Provision for dismantling of fixed assets
92 To provide for expenses for dismantling unused decrepit buildings, estimated future expenses are recorded.
(5) Accounting method for retirement benefits
1) Attribution method for projected retirement benefits:
In calculating retirement benefits obligations, benefit-formula attribution is adopted for the purpose of attributing projected retire- ment benefits to the period up to the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.
2) Treatment of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs: Prior service costs are amortized equally over a certain number of years (10 years in principle) within the average remaining years of service for the employees at the time of accrual, or are charged to income collectively at the time of accrual. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized by the straight-line method over a certain number of years (10 years in principle) within average remaining years of service for the employees at the time of accrual in each fiscal year, commencing from the following fiscal year after the accrual for each employee, or are charged to income collectively in the following fiscal year after the accrual.
(6) Accounting for significant hedge
1) Hedge accounting
The Group adopts deferred hedge accounting. However, special treatment is used for qualifying interest rate swap transactions. Moreover, allocation hedge accounting is applied to qualifying currency swap transactions and forward exchange contracts.
2) Hedging instruments and hedged items
Hedging instrument: Currency swaps, interest rate swaps, and forward exchange contracts
Hedged item: Interest on loans payable, receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies
3) Hedge policy
Derivative instruments are used to mitigate risks associated with foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations.
As a rule, hedging is only used for items in which actual demand exists, and not for speculative purposes.
4) Evaluation of hedge effectiveness
Hedge effectiveness is evaluated through comparative analysis of the cumulative fluctuations in the market between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Evaluation of hedge effectiveness at fiscal year-end is omitted for currency swap transactions, as material con- ditions for the notional principal of hedging instruments and those for hedged items are the same and these transactions are deemed to offset the market fluctuations.
Evaluation of hedge effectiveness at fiscal year-end is omitted also for interest rate swap transactions applied to special treatment.
(7) Amortization method and period of goodwill
If the duration of the effect of goodwill can be rationally estimated, amortization is made over the estimated number of years by the straight-line method. In other cases, amortization is made over a five-year-period by the straight-line method.
(8) Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows
In preparing the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash on hand, readily available deposits and short-term highly liquid invest- ments with maturities not exceeding three months at the time of purchase are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.
(9) Accounting method for consumption taxes
Consumption taxes and local consumption taxes are accounted using the net-of-tax method, and non-deductible consumption taxes and local consumption taxes on assets are posted mainly as expenses when incurred.
(10) Application of the Consolidated Taxation System
The Company and certain domestic consolidated subsidiaries applied the Consolidated Taxation System.
3 Changes in Accounting Policies (1) ApplicationofIFRS16“Leases”
Subsidiaries using International Financial Reporting Standards started to apply IFRS No.16 Lease (hereinafter referred to as “IFRS 16”) from the current fiscal year. In accordance with IFRS 16, lessees are required to recognize almost all leases as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Having followed the transitional treatment regarding the application of IFRS 16, the cumulative effects of the changes in the accounting policies were added to (subtracted from) the opening balance of retained earnings for the current consolidated fiscal year. As a result, “Other, net” in noncurrent assets was ¥3,569 million increased, and “Other” in current liabilities and in noncurrent liabilities were ¥581 million, ¥2,979 million increased, respectively, as of the end of the current fiscal year. Also the beginning balance for retained earnings was ¥147 million decreased. The impact of these changes on the profit or loss for the current fiscal year was immaterial.
4 Unapplied New Accounting Standards
The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries
– “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No. 29, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on March 31, 2020)
– “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No. 30, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on March 31, 2020)
(1) Overview
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) jointly developed comprehensive revenue recognition standards and issued “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” in May 2014 (IASB’s IFRS 15 and FASB’s Topic 606). Considering that IFRS 15 shall apply to fiscal
(11) Application of tax effect accounting for the transition from the consolidated tax payment system to the group taxation system
Having regard to paragraph 3 of “Practical Solution on the Treatment of Tax Effect Accounting for the Transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Tax Sharing System” (PITF No.39, March 31, 2020), the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries did not follow paragraph 44 of “Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ Guidance No. 28, February 16, 2018) but applied provisions of pre-amended tax laws when calculating the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities that relate to transitioning to the group taxation system and related amendments of tax laws for transitioning to the single tax payment system.
(2) Application of ASU No.2016-01 “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” Subsidiaries that apply the U.S. Accounting Standards adopted the
U.S. FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-01 “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (hereinafter, “ASU No. 2016-01”) from the current fiscal year. Herewith, investments in equity securities, with the exception of equity-method investments and consolidated investments, are measured at fair value and their fluctuations are recognized in net profit. In initially applying ASU No. 2016-01, retained earnings have been adjusted for the cumulative effects of the application at the beginning of the fiscal year with the transitional treatment of the standard.
As a result, retained earnings increased by ¥283 million, and the valuation difference on available-for-sale securities decreased by ¥283 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The impact of these changes on the profit or loss for the current fiscal year was immaterial.
years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and Topic 606 shall apply to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, the ASBJ developed a comprehensive accounting standard on revenue recognition and thus issued the accounting standard together with the implementation guidance.
The ASBJ established the accounting standard on revenue recognition
by following the basic policies in developing it. The basic policies
were: firstly, incorporating the core principle of IFRS 15 as the starting
point from the perspective of facilitating comparability among financial statements, which is one of the benefits of ensuring consistency with
IFRS 15; secondly, adding alternative treatments, but to the extent not
impairing comparability, where consideration should be given to the
practice having been used in Japan. 93

For each business segment, the Company classifies assets or asset groups based on whether their cash flows can be estimated independently. The book values of assets or asset groups whose market values declined significantly or that are projected to consistently generate negative cash flows are reduced to their
recoverable value. The amount of this reduction is deemed an impairment loss and is recorded under “Other expenses” in the consolidated financial statements.
Recoverable values are calculated based on memorandum values, as no future cash flows are expected.

                                  18
(5) Method of calculating interest expenses equivalent
Interest expenses equivalent are calculated as the difference between total lease charges and acquisition cost equivalent of leased items, and are allocated to each fiscal year using the interest method.
(2) The methods of depreciation for lease assets
The methods of depreciation for lease assets are as follows: Lease assets involving finance lease transactions under which the ownership of the lease assets is transferred to lessees are the same methods that are applied to property, plant and equipment owned by the Company. Lease assets involving finance lease transactions under which the ownership of the lease assets is not transferred to lessees are the straight-line method, with their residual values being zero over their leased periods used as the number of years for useful life.
(2) Depreciation method of right-of-use assets
The lease period or the useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter, is used as the useful life, and the residual value is calculated as zero.

3. Operating lease transactions
Future lease payments for operating lease transactions which cannot be canceled as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:
In addition, some compound financial instruments are also continuously reviewed by regularly checking their fair values.
With regard to derivative transactions, the financial department or the accounting department executes and manages transactions upon obtaining internal approvals in compliance with the derivative transactions management rules of each Group company. In addition, reports on the situations of derivative transactions are made to each company’s Board of Directors’ meeting when and where appropriate. 3) Liquidity risk management on fund-raising (risk for delinquency) Trade payables and loans are exposed to liquidity risk. In the Group, liquidity risk is managed by setting an appropriate fund balance for each company, and by each company updating fund plans monthly to maintain the balance that exceeds the set fund balance, and by the Company confirming each company’s cash position.
(4) Supplementary explanations concerning fair values of financial instruments
Fair values of financial instruments comprise values determined based on market prices and values determined reasonably when there is no market price. Since variable factors are incorporated in calculating the relevant fair values, such fair values may vary depending on the different assumptions. The notional amounts and other infor- mation described in “Note 13–Derivative Transactions” do not indicate the amounts of market risk exposed to derivative transactions.

      Note: The primary cause for the decrease in operating lease transactions was the payment of lease payables related to the leased offices of the Group’s headquarters, and the recording of right-of-use assets at certain overseas consolidated subsidiaries from the current fiscal year.
11 FinancialInstruments
1. Outline of financial instruments
(1) Policyforfinancialinstruments
The Group signed an agreement concerning commitment lines with financial institutions, such as securing medium to long-term fund liquidity with the Company as a holding company, as a safety net for the entire Group. In addition, capital for each business is financed based on the financial plan as needed, through bank borrowings or bond issues applying the Cash Management System for the purpose of efficient utilization of the Group’s funds. Most funds are invested primarily in low-risk and high-liquidity financial assets, while some are invested in compound financial instruments such as bonds, etc., for the purpose of efficiently managing funds. Derivatives are used, not for speculative purposes, but to manage exposure to financial risks as described later.
(2) Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments
Receivables such as notes and accounts receivable-trade are exposed to customer credit risks. In addition, foreign currency-denominated trade receivables are exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctua- tion risks. However, certain parts of the risks are hedged by forward exchange contracts. Short-term investment securities and investment securities are mainly negotiable certificates of deposit and the stocks acquired for business collaborations with business partners, and the latter are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Some compound financial instruments, etc., are also exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations in the stock markets, etc.
Of the payables such as notes and accounts payable-trade, trade payables denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risks. Loans and bonds payable are for the purpose of procurement of funds necessary for operating funds and capital investment, and parts of them have floating interest rates. For this reason, they are exposed to interest rate fluctuation risks.
Derivative transactions are interest rate swap transactions to hedge interest rate fluctuation risk associated with loans payables.
For details on hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policy and the method for evaluating hedging effectiveness concerning hedge accounting, please refer to “(6) Accounting for significant hedge” in “Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, 3. Accounting policies.”
(3) Risk management for financial instruments
1) Credit risk management (customers’ default risk)
With respect to trade receivables, departments in charge regularly monitor the situations of major customers in compliance with each company’s management regulations for receivables, to control pay- ment terms and balances of customers, in order to detect collection concerns such as worsening of financial conditions early and to lessen the possibilities for collection problems.
The credit risk for negotiable certificates of deposit and major bonds, etc., is minimal because the investments of these financial assets are limited to high credit rating issuers. Customers of derivative transactions are in principle limited to correspondent financial institutions.
The amount of maximum risk as of the consolidated settlement date is expressed by the amounts of financial assets exposed to credit risks in the balance sheet.
2) Market risk management (foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuation risks)
Interest rate swap transactions, etc., are used to hedge fluctuation risks of interests on variable interest loans.
With respect to short-term investment securities and investment securities, their fair values and financial positions of the related issuers (the counterparties) are regularly checked for reports at each company’s Board of Directors’ meeting, etc. Major holdings of shares are continuously reviewed in consideration of relationships with the counterparties.
2. Matters concerning the fair value of financial instruments
The consolidated balance sheet amount and fair value of financial instruments as well as the differences between these values are described below. Financial instruments whose fair values are not readily determinable are not included in the table. (See Note 2 below.)

Of these, items that are settled in the short term (within a year) are recorded using book values, as their fair values approximate book values. In addition, of notes and accounts receivable-trade, those which have more than a year to the payment date from the end of the current fiscal year are stated at the present values by discounting the amount of claim for each receivable with the interest rate calculated by the payment period and credit risk.
(3) Short-term investment securities and investment securities
The fair values of stocks are determined using the quoted price on the stock exchange, and those of bonds are determined using the quoted price on the exchange or the quoted price obtained from financial institutions. In addition, negotiable certificates of deposit included in available-for-sale securities are recorded using book values, as they are settled in the short term (within a year) and their fair values approximate book values. For notes concerning securities by holding purpose, please see “Note 12–Investment Securities.”
Liabilities
(1) Notes and accounts payable-trade, (2) Short-term loans payable and (4) Current portion of corporate bonds
Of these, items that are settled in the short term (within a year) are recorded using book values, as their fair values approximate book values. Of the short-term loans payable, fair values of the loans hedged by interest rate swap contracts meeting certain conditions are calculated by combining them with the relevant interest rate swap.
(3) Long-term loans payable and (5) Corporate bonds payable
These are stated with the present values calculated by discounting the aggregated values of the principal and interest using an assumed interest rate if loans are newly made. Of the long-term loans payable, fair values of the loans hedged by interest rate swap contracts with special treatment applied and by interest rate and currency swap contracts with combined treatment applied (subject to special treatment and allocation hedge accounting) are calculated by combining them with the relevant interest rate swap or interest rate and currency swap.

The merger will be treated as a transaction under common control in accordance with the “Accounting Standard for Business Combinations” (ASBJ Statement No. 21, January 16, 2019), and “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Business Combinations and Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures” (ASBJ Guidance No. 10, January 16, 2019).
2. Changes in segment classification, etc.
Because of greater efforts to promote synergy effects from the “Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business” in the development of gaming machines, commencing the following fiscal year, as part of reclassification of the Group’s reporting segments, the businesses operated by SEGA SAMMY CREATION INC. included in the former “Entertainment Contents Business” will now be changed to the “Pachislot and Pachinko Machines Business.”
In addition, as an evaluation index for the performance-linked remuneration of Directors’ bonuses of the Company, the Company positions “ordinary income,” which is the income obtained by the Group on a recurring basis from the overall business, including equity in earnings and losses of affiliates, etc., as an important target figure. Through such perspective of a management approach, the Company decided to change the measurement methods of segment income from “operating income” to “ordinary income” from the following fiscal year.
Information on the amounts of net sales, income (loss) by each reporting segment for the current fiscal year in the case of application of the new segment classification is as follows.

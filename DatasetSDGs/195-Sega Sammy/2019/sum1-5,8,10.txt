Aim of Setting Out “Enhancement of Job Satisfaction and Diversity and
Elimination of Inequality” as a Theme
The diverse values and talents of our personnel are the source of the innovations that we create as an entertainment com- pany. Also, as a super low birth rate and aging society approaches, we believe that it is important to prevent the loss of human capital caused by employees resigning to provide family members with nursing care, for example. With this in mind, we are creating workplace environments that are amenable to diverse work styles.Results

  Reduction of Long Overtime Hours
The SEGA SAMMY Group has been taking measures to reduce long overtime hours since 2013. Measures such as consultations with superiors for employees working long overtime hours and the issuance of individual alerts for employees in relation to overtime hours per month have lowered those working more than 80 hours of overtime per month to approximately 1.0% of all employees.
Further, for the Group as a whole the percentage of paid leave taken is improving steadily, reaching 69.5%. P.75
· Labor training, compliance training (establishing and improving awareness)
· Management of attendance status, enforcement of punching-in (check for excessive or unpaid overtime)
· Individual alerts for employees on a monthly basis
· Monthly reports on number of employees working overtime and
amounts of overtime (Releasing report through executive com- mittee or the council of managing directors and sharing informa- tion regarding actual conditions)
· Consultations with superiors for employees working long over- time hours
· Establishment and fixation of no-overtime and no-meeting days
· Adjustment of work volumes, streamlining of meetings, revision
of operational flow, etc.
Promotion of Work–Life Balance
With our sights set on full-fledged introduction of flextime and telework systems, we introduced these systems on a trial basis at major operating companies between June and November 2018. At the same time, we conducted questionnaire surveys of employees and established a range of systems. We have introduced a work-at-home system, which recognizes work performed by employees outside of the office, and the Job Plus (JOB+) side job system, allowing certain employees to obtain side job employment. Also, initiatives to encourage respect for diversity included the establishment of workplace environments in which LGBT employees feel comfortable working in February 2019.

 Relocation and Consolidation of Head Office Functions
In 2018, the Group consolidated its head office functions at a new office. By eliminating physical distances between Group companies’ offices and having shared functions between divisions, we have established an environment that removes barriers among divisions, encourages interaction between personnel, and is conducive to business collaboration and synergy creation. With a view to enhancing productivity, we have introduced leading-edge information and communications technology (ICT) to all companies that have relocated to the office. Further, the new office includes a co-working space of 1,322 square meters, which supports the businesses of startups and individual entrepreneurs. In addition, we are eliminating overlapping functions by using the relocation as an opportunity to consoli- date management functions in such areas as accounting, human resources, finance, general affairs, legal affairs, and IT solutions integrate licensing functions and streamline decision-making processes.
Opening of SEGA SAMMY Soramori Nursery School —New Work Styles for Employees with Children
Aiming to help employees meet their work and child-rearing responsibilities, we opened SEGA SAMMY Soramori Nursery School in April 2019. Employees can commute with their children because the new facility is an in-house nursery school located in a building next to the head office. We will continue developing environments that enable employees engaged in child-rearing to fully realize their talents.
Participation in Tokyo Rainbow Pride 2019
The SEGA SAMMY Group promotes diversity to help realize a society in which many different individuals can play important roles. As part of these efforts, we participated in Tokyo Rainbow Pride 2019, which heightened society’s awareness of LGBT individuals and other sexual minorities and celebrated gender and identity diversity. Approximately 40 of our employees and their families took part in the Tokyo Rainbow Pride 2019 parade held on April 28. We endorse the realization of a society that makes it easier for everyone to be themselves and live with positivity, enjoyment, and pride.

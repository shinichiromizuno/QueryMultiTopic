“Watch-Over” System in an Aging Society
The number of people requiring nursing care continues to rise in Japan. Despite this, there is a shortage of care workers, exacerbating the burden on personnel in nursing homes.
The care support solutions provided by Kaga Electronics involve a 24-hour “watch-over” system for residents that utilizes sensors in the ceiling. The sensors detect when someone wakes or gets out of bed as well as when an incident occurs, such as a tumble over or abnormal breathing, and a notification is sent to the worker’s smartphone along with live images. Being able to check the state of the resident through the images allows an appropriate action and judgment on the spot, significantly enhancing operational efficiency. Facilities that have introduced the system have achieved an increase in work efficiency of around 30%.

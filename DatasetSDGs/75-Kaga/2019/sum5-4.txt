Wearable Device and Support of People with Disabilities
The Kaga Electronics Group company Fujitsu Electronics manufactures and sells Ontenna, a user interface device that lets users sense sound with their bodies. The Ontenna device can be worn by users in their hair or on their shirt collar, for example, and it can convert sound vibration patterns from an audio source between approximately 60 and 90 dB to 256 levels of vibration and light strength. This means that people with hearing impairment can feel the rhythm, pattern and loudness of sounds. Application of the device is expected in such areas as sports and cultural events as well as schools for the hearing impaired. By providing this product, we aim to realize a future that both people with hearing impairments and those with ordinary hearing can enjoy together.

Healthcare Combined with the IoT
In daycare centers, nursery teachers check on the condition of each child every few minutes during naptime as part of safety measures. The IoT sensors that Kaga Electronics markets for children’s futons are placed directly under the mattress, and they detect and display in real time the state of a child’s breathing and heart rate during naps to assist nursery teachers with their checking duties. If a change is detected, notification is given via visual and audio alerts on the smartphone or tablet app, so that the child can be checked on immediately. This product helps to boost the safety of children during sleep as well as alleviate the psychological burden on the part of the teacher.

Work-Style Reform and Collaborative Investment
Securing labor has become a real social challenge in Japan. Despite this, there are many women who want to work yet are unable to because they cannot put their children in daycare. This has prompted the need to create a more accommodating work environment for women
during their child-rearing years. Kaga Electronics has invested in
mama square Co., Ltd., which develops and operates working spaces equipped with childcare facilities throughout Japan. We are reinforcing ties with mama square in fields such as facility layout and infrastructure creation. The working spaces run by mama square include an adjacent kidsâ€™ area where children can spend time safely, providing a reassuring work environment for mothers.
